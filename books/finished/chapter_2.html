A chart at the bottom shows four components of the Conceptual Framework For Financial Reporting. The first is Conceptual Framework with four bullet points listed as, need for conceptual framework; development of a conceptual framework; overview of the conceptual framework; and basic objective.
The second component is labeled fundamental concepts with 2 bullet points listed as qualitative characteristics of accounting information, and basic elements.
The third component is labeled as assumptions, which includes economic entity; going concern; monetary unit; and periodicity.
The last component is Measurement, Recognition, and Disclosure Concepts, consisting of basic principles of accounting; cost constraint; and the summary of the structure."

        Everyone agrees that accounting needs a framework—a conceptual

            To supplement donations collected from its general community
            solicitation, Tri-Cities United Charities holds an annual lottery
            sweepstakes. In this year’s sweepstakes, United Charities is
            offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to a single winning ticket
            holder. A total of 10,000 tickets have been printed, and United
            Charities plans to sell all the tickets at a price of $150 each.
          </p>
          <p data-index="63">
            Since its inception, the sweepstakes has attracted area-wide
            interest, and United Charities has always been able to meet its
            sales target. However, in the unlikely event that it might fail to
            sell a sufficient number of tickets to cover the grand prize, United
            Charities has reserved the right to cancel the sweepstakes and to
            refund the price of the tickets to holders.
          </p>
          <p data-index="64">
            In recent years, a fairly active secondary market for tickets has
            developed. This year, buying–selling prices have varied between $75
            and $95 before stabilizing at about $90.
          </p>
          <p data-index="65">
            When the tickets first went on sale this year, multimillionaire Phil
            N. Tropic, well-known in Tri-Cities civic circles as a generous but
            sometimes eccentric donor, bought one of the tickets from United
            Charities, paying $150 cash.

            Situation 2: The $20 Million Question
          </h3>
          <p data-index="80">
            The Hard Rock Mining Company has just completed the first year of
            operations at its new strip mine, the Lonesome Doe. Hard Rock spent
            $10 million for the land and $20 million in preparing the site for
            mining operations. The Mine is expected to operate for 20 years.
            Hard Rock is subject to environmental statutes requiring it to
            restore the Lonesome Doe Mine site on completion of mining
            operations.
          </p>
          <p data-index="81">
            Based on its experience and industry data, as well as current
            technology, Hard Rock forecasts that restoration will cost about $10
            million when it is undertaken. Of those costs, about $4 million is
            for restoring the topsoil that was removed in preparing the site for
            mining operations (prior to opening the mine). The rest is directly
            proportional to the depth of the mine, which in turn is directly
            proportional to the amount of ore extracted.

        restoring the topsoil. How should Hard Rock account for this change in

        The answer to the questions on the two situations depends on how assets
        and liabilities are defined and how they should be valued. Hopefully,
        this chapter will provide you with a framework to resolve questions like
        these.

        <p data-index="131">
          Why do we need a conceptual framework? First, to be useful,
          rule-making should build on and relate to an established body of
          concepts. A soundly developed conceptual framework thus enables the
          FASB to issue
          <b data-index="132"
            >more useful and consistent pronouncements over time; a coherent set
            of standards should result</b
          >. Indeed, without the guidance provided by a soundly developed
          framework, standard-setting ends up being based on individual concepts
          developed by each member of the standard-setting body. The following
          observation by a former standard-setter highlights the problem.
        </p>

        <p class="extract" data-index="133">
          As our professional careers unfold, each of us develops a technical
          conceptual framework. Some individual frameworks are sharply defined
          and firmly held; others are vague and weakly held; still others are
          vague and firmly held. . . . At one time or another, most of us have
          felt the discomfort of listening to somebody buttress a preconceived
          conclusion by building a convoluted chain of shaky reasoning. Indeed,
          perhaps on occasion we have voiced such thinking ourselves. . . . My
          experience . . . taught me many lessons. A major one was that most of
          us have a natural tendency and an incredible talent for processing new
          facts in such a way that our prior conclusions remain intact.<sup

          In other words, standard-setting that is based on personal conceptual
          frameworks will lead to different conclusions about identical or
          similar issues than it did previously. As a result, standards will not
          be consistent with one another, and past decisions may not be
          indicative of future ones. Furthermore, the framework should increase
          financial statement users’ understanding of and confidence in
          financial reporting. It should enhance comparability among companies’
          financial statements (see

              process, many have argued that regulators should move toward
              principles-based rules. They believe that companies exploited the
              detailed provisions in rules-based pronouncements to manage
              accounting reports, rather than report the economic substance of
              transactions.

            <p class="B2" data-index="169">
              For example, many of the off-balance-sheet arrangements of Enron
              avoided transparent reporting by barely achieving 3&nbsp;percent
              outside equity ownership, a requirement in an obscure accounting
              rule interpretation. Enron’s financial engineers were able to
              structure transactions to achieve a desired accounting treatment,
              even if that accounting treatment did not reflect the
              transaction’s true nature. Under principles-based rules, hopefully
              top management’s financial reporting focus will shift from
              demonstrating compliance with rules to demonstrating that a
              company has attained the objective of financial reporting.

          own conceptual frameworks, but no single framework was universally

          a conceptual framework that would be a basis for setting accounting

The first level is on the bottom and labeled as the objective of financial reporting, the “why”, or purpose of accounting. The second level appears next, with two components, and represents the bridge between levels 1 and 3. Qualitative characteristics of accounting information and elements of financial statements are the two components.
The third level crosses the top of the triangle with three components representing the “how” or implementation of the standards.

          information they need from an entity and therefore must rely, at least
          partly, on the information provided in financial reports. However, an

          business and financial accounting matters to understand the
          information contained in financial statements. This point is
          important. It means that financial statement preparers assume a level
          of competence on the part of users. This assumption impacts the way
          and the extent to which companies report information.

          Regardless of classification, each qualitative characteristic
          contributes to the decision-usefulness of financial reporting
          information. However, providing useful financial information is
          limited by a constraint on financial reporting—cost should not exceed
          the benefits of a reporting practice.

            if omitting it or misstating it would influence decisions that users
            make on the basis of the reported financial information. An
            individual company determines whether information is material

            information relates must be considered in the context of an

            During the period in question, the revenues and expenses, and
            therefore the net incomes of Company A and Company B, are
            proportional. Each reported an unusual gain. In looking at the
            abbreviated income figures for Company A, it appears insignificant
            whether the amount of the unusual gain is set out separately or
            merged with the regular operating income. The gain is only 2 percent
            of the operating income. If merged, it would not seriously distort
            the income figure. Company B has had an unusual gain of only $5,000.
            However, it is relatively much more significant than the larger gain
            realized by Company A. For Company B, an item of $5,000 amounts to
            50 percent of its income from operations. Obviously, the inclusion
            of such an item in operating income would affect the amount of that
            income materially. Thus, we see the importance of the
            <b data-index="396">relative size </b>of an item in determining its
            materiality.

          <p data-index="397">
            Companies and their auditors generally adopt the rule of thumb that
            anything under 5 percent of net income is considered immaterial.
            However, much can depend on specific rules. For example, one market
            regulator indicates that a company may use this percentage for an
            initial assessment of materiality, but it must also consider other
            factors. For example, companies can no longer fail to record items
            in order to meet consensus analysts’ earnings

            Thus, it is generally not feasible to specify uniform quantitative
            thresholds at which an item becomes material. Rather, materiality
            judgments should be made in the context of the nature and the amount
            of an item. Materiality factors into a great many internal
            accounting decisions, too. Examples of such judgments that companies
            must make include the amount of classification required in a
            subsidiary expense ledger, the degree of accuracy required in
            allocating expenses among the departments of a company, and the
            extent to which adjustments should be made for accrued and deferred
            items. Only by

                material misstatement that misled investors about the company’s
                financial position. The SEC has called for a number of

                incorrect accounting. In some cases, the restatements did not
                meet traditional materiality thresholds. Don Nicholaisen, then
                SEC chief accountant, observed that whether the amount is
                material or not, some transactions appear to be “flat out
                intended to mislead investors.” In essence he is saying that
                even small accounting errors for a transaction can represent
                important information to the users of financial statements.

            means that the numbers and descriptions match what ­really existed
            or happened. Faithful representation is a necessity because most
            users have neither the time nor the expertise to evaluate the
            factual content of the information. For example, if
            <span class="red" data-index="444"
              ><b data-index="445">General Motors</b></span

            $162,300 million when it had sales of $145,588 million, then the
            statement fails to faithfully represent the proper sales amount. To
            be a faithful representation, information must be complete, neutral,
            and free of material error.

              have been filed because of tobacco-related health concerns—even
              though such disclosure is damaging to the company.

            <p data-index="464">
              Neutrality in rule-making has come under increasing attack. Some
              argue that the FASB should not issue pronouncements that cause
              undesirable economic effects on an industry or company. We
              disagree. Accounting rules (and the standard-setting process) must
              be free from bias, or we will no longer have credible financial
              statements. Without credible financial statements, individuals
              will no longer use this information. An analogy demonstrates the
              point: Many individuals bet on boxing matches because such
              contests are assumed not to be fixed. But nobody bets on wrestling
              matches. Why? Because the public assumes that wrestling matches
              are rigged. If financial information is biased (rigged), the
              public will lose confidence and no longer use it.<sup

              item. For example, if

              misstates its loan losses, its financial statements are misleading
              and not a faithful representation of its financial results.
              However, faithful representation does not imply total freedom from
              error. This is because most financial reporting measures involve
              estimates of various types that incorporate management’s judgment.
              For example, management must estimate the amount of uncollectible
              accounts to determine bad debt expense. And determination of
              depreciation expense requires estimation of useful lives of plant
              and equipment, as well as the salvage value of the assets.

                  Some young technology companies, in an effort to attract
                  investors who will help them strike it rich, are using

              accounting for pensions in Japan differed from that in the United
              States. In Japan, companies generally recorded little or no charge
              to income for these costs. U.S. companies recorded pension cost as

              Other users, however, do not understand the report’s content and
              significance. They are surprised when Facebook declares a smaller
              year-end dividend and the share price declines. Thus, although
              Facebook presented highly relevant information that was a faithful

          distinctive and specific meanings. These terms constitute the language
          of business or the jargon of accounting.
        </p>
        <p data-index="578">
          One such term is <b data-index="579">asset</b>. Is it merely something
          we own? Or is an asset something we have the right to use, as in the
          case of leased equipment? Or is it anything of value used by a company
          to generate revenues—in which case, should we also consider the
          managers of a company as an asset?
        </p>
        <p data-index="580">
          As this example and the sweepstakes example in the opening story
          illustrate, it therefore seems necessary to develop basic definitions
          for the elements of financial statements.
          <i data-index="581">SFAC No. 6</i> defines the 10 interrelated
          elements that most directly relate to measuring the performance and
          financial status of a business enterprise. We list them below for
          review and information purposes; you need not memorize these
          definitions at this point. We will explain and examine each of these
          elements in more detail in subsequent chapters.
        </p>
        <p data-index="582">
          The FASB classifies the elements into two distinct groups. The first
          group of three elements—assets, liabilities, and equity—describes
          amounts of resources and claims to resources at a
          <b data-index="583">moment in time</b>. The other seven elements
          describe transactions, events, and circumstances that affect a company
          during a <b data-index="584">period of time</b>. The first class,
          affected by elements of the second class, provides at any time the
          cumulative result of all changes. This interaction is referred to as
          “articulation.” That is, key figures in one financial statement
          correspond to balances in another.

        The third level of the framework consists of concepts that implement the
        basic objective of level one. These concepts explain how companies
        should recognize, measure, and report financial elements and events. The
        FASB sets forth most of these in its

        an “element of financial statements” as defined in

          Despite numerous business failures, most companies have a fairly high
          continuance rate. As a rule, we expect companies to last long enough
          to fulfill their objectives and commitments.

        <p data-index="712">
          This assumption has significant implications. The historical cost
          principle would be of limited usefulness if we assume eventual
          liquidation. Under a liquidation approach, for example, a company
          would better state asset values at net realizable value (sales price
          less costs of disposal) than at acquisition cost.
          <b data-index="713"
            >Depreciation and amortization policies are justifiable and
            appropriate only if we assume some permanence to the company.</b
          >
          If a company adopts the liquidation approach, the current/noncurrent
          classification of assets and liabilities loses much of its
          significance. Labeling anything a fixed or long-term asset would be
          difficult to justify. Indeed, listing liabilities on the basis of
          priority in liquidation would be more reasonable.

              Due to their experiences with persistent inflation, several South
              American countries produce “constant-currency” financial reports.

          To measure the results of a company’s activity accurately, we would
          need to wait until it liquidates. Decision-makers, however, cannot
          wait that long for such information. Users need to know a company’s
          performance and economic status on a timely basis so that they can
          evaluate and compare firms, and take appropriate actions. Therefore,
          companies must report information periodically.

        <p data-index="749">
          The shorter the time period, the more difficult it is to determine the
          proper net income for the period. A month’s results usually prove less
          verifiable than a quarter’s results, and a quarter’s results are
          likely to be less verifiable than a year’s results. Investors desire
          and demand that a company quickly process and disseminate information.
          Yet the quicker a company releases the information, the more likely
          the information will include errors.

              GAAP requires that companies account for and report many assets
              and liabilities on the basis of acquisition price. This is often
              referred to as the

              To illustrate this advantage, consider the problems if companies
              select current selling price instead. Companies might have

              value on every asset each time they wished to determine income.
              Critics raise similar objections against current cost (replacement

              What about liabilities? Do companies account for them on a cost
              basis? Yes, they do. Companies issue liabilities, such as bonds,
              notes, and accounts payable, in exchange for assets (or services),
              for an agreed-upon price.

              A company uses this amount to record the liability in the accounts

              Recently, GAAP has increasingly called for use of fair value
              measurements in the financial statements. This is often referred

                ></span
              >. Fair value information may be more useful than historical cost
              for certain types of assets and liabilities and in certain
              industries. For example, companies report many financial
              instruments, including derivatives, at fair value. Certain
              industries, such as brokerage houses and mutual funds, prepare
              their basic financial statements on a fair value basis.
            </p>
            <p data-index="801">
              At initial acquisition, historical cost equals fair value. In
              subsequent periods, as market and economic conditions change,
              historical cost and fair value often diverge. Thus, fair value
              measures or estimates often provide more relevant information
              about the expected future cash flows related to the asset or
              liability. For example, when long-lived assets decline in value, a
              fair value measure determines any impairment loss. In this
              situation, the FASB believes that fair value information is more
              relevant to users than historical cost. Fair value measurement, it
              is argued, provides better insight into the value of a company’s
              assets and liabilities (its financial position) and a better basis
              for assessing future cash flow prospects.

              Recently, the Board has taken the additional step of giving

              The Board considers fair value more relevant than historical cost
              because it reflects the current cash equivalent value of financial
              instruments. As a result, companies now have the option to record
              fair value in their accounts for most financial instruments,
              including such items as receivables and debt securities.

              Use of fair value in financial reporting is increasing. However,
              measurement based on fair value introduces increased subjectivity
              into accounting reports when fair value information is not readily
              available. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value
              measures, the FASB established a fair value hierarchy that

              It is easy to arrive at fair values when markets are liquid with
              many traders, but fair value answers are not readily available in
              other situations. For example, how do you value the mortgage
              assets of a subprime lender given that the market for these
              securities has essentially disappeared? A great deal of expertise
              and sound judgment will be needed to arrive at appropriate
              answers. GAAP also provides guidance on estimating fair values
              when market-related data is not available. In general, these
              valuation issues relate to Level 3 fair value measurements. These
              measurements may be developed using expected cash flow and present
              value techniques, as described in

              As indicated above, we presently have a “mixed-attribute” system
              that permits the use of historical cost and fair value. Although
              the historical cost principle continues to be an important basis
              for valuation, recording and reporting of fair value information
              is increasing. The recent measurement and disclosure guidance
              should increase consistency and comparability when fair value
              measurements are used in the financial statements and related
              notes.

Step 1 to identify the contract or contracts with the customer. A contract is an agreement between two parties that creates enforceable rights or obligations. In this case, Boeing has signed a contract to deliver airplanes to Delta.
Step 2 is to identify the separate performance obligations in the contract. Boeing has only one performance obligation, to deliver airplanes to Delta. If Boeing also agreed to maintain the planes, a separate performance obligation is recorded for this promise.
Step 3 is to determine the transaction price. Transaction price is the amount of consideration that a company expects to receive from a customer in exchange for transferring a good or service. In this case, the transaction price is straightforward, it is $100 million.
Step 4 is to allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations. In this case, Boeing has only one performance obligation, to deliver airplanes to Delta.
Step 5 is to recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Boeing recognizes revenue of $100 million for the sale of the airplanes to Delta when it satisfies its performance obligation, the delivery of the airplanes to Delta.

            Many revenue transactions pose few problems because the transaction

            when a performance obligation is satisfied over time. This is common

            as a result of delivering or producing goods and/or performing

            To illustrate, companies recognize expenses not when they pay wages
            or make a product, but when the work (service) or the product

            recognition to revenue recognition. That is, by matching

            Some costs, however, are difficult to associate with revenue. As a
            result, some other approach must be developed. Often, companies use
            a “rational and systematic” allocation policy that will approximate
            the expense recognition principle. This type of expense recognition
            involves assumptions about the benefits that a company receives as
            well as the cost associated with those benefits. For example, a

            In deciding what information to report, companies follow the general
            practice of providing information that is of sufficient importance
            to influence the judgment and decisions of an informed user. Often
            referred to as the
            <span class="glossTerm" data-index="936"

            >, it recognizes that the nature and amount of information included
            in financial reports reflects a series of judgmental trade-offs.
            These trade-offs strive for (1) sufficient detail to disclose
            matters that <b data-index="939">make a difference</b> to users, yet
            (2) sufficient condensation to make the
            <b data-index="940">information understandable</b>, keeping in mind
            costs of preparing and using it.

          <p data-index="941">
            Disclosure is not a substitute for proper accounting. As a former
            chief accountant of the SEC noted, “Good disclosure does not cure
            bad accounting any more than an adjective or adverb can be used
            without, or in place of, a noun or verb.” Thus, for example,
            cash-<br data-index="942" />basis accounting for cost of goods sold
            is misleading even if a company discloses accrual-basis amounts in
            the notes to the financial statements.

            company, the notes should provide the additional information needed.
            Information in the notes does not have to be quantifiable, nor does
            it need to qualify as an element. Notes can be partially or totally
            narrative. Examples of notes include descriptions of the accounting
            policies and methods used in measuring the elements reported in the
            statements, explanations of uncertainties and contingencies, and
            statistics and details too voluminous for inclusion in the

          In providing information with the qualitative characteristics that
          make it useful, companies must consider an overriding factor that
          limits (constrains) the reporting. This is referred to as the

          information against the benefits that can be derived from using it.
          Rule-making bodies and governmental agencies use cost-benefit analysis
          before making final their informational requirements. In order to
          justify requiring a particular measurement or disclosure, the benefits
          perceived to be derived from it must exceed the costs perceived to be
          associated with it.

          Although extreme, this remark indicates the frustration expressed by
          members of the business community about rule-making and whether the
          benefits of a given pronouncement exceed the costs.
        </p>
        <p data-index="975">
          The difficulty in cost-benefit analysis is that the costs and
          especially the benefits are not always evident or measurable. The
          costs are of several kinds: costs of collecting and processing, of
          disseminating, of auditing, of potential litigation, of disclosure to
          competitors, and of analysis and interpretation. Benefits to preparers
          may include greater management control and access to capital at a
          lower cost. Users may receive better information for allocation of
          resources, tax assessment, and rate regulation. As noted earlier,
          benefits are generally more difficult to quantify than are costs.

          The implementation of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
          illustrates the challenges in assessing costs and benefits of
          standards. One study estimated the increased costs of complying with
          the new internal-control standards related to the financial reporting
          process to be an average of $7.8 million per company. However, the
          study concluded that “quantifying the benefits of improved more
          reliable financial reporting is not fully possible.” More recent data
          on compliance indicate that after more than a decade of experience
          with Sarbanes-Oxley, 61 percent of companies spend less than $500,000
          annually on compliance, and 28 percent spend more than $1,000,000. And

            alt="An illustration shows the conceptual framework for financial reporting illustrated as an inverted triangle divided into three levels. 
The first level is on the bottom and labeled as the objective of financial reporting, the “why”, or purpose of accounting. The objective is to provide information about the reporting entity that is useful to present and potential equity investors, lenders, and other creditors in their capacity as capital providers.
The second level appears next, with two components, and represents the bridge between levels 1 and 3. Qualitative characteristics of accounting information and elements of financial statements are the two components.
The qualitative characteristics are in two groups, fundamental qualities and enhancing qualities. The fundamental qualities include relevance consisting of predictive value, confirmatory value, and materiality, and faithful representation consisting of completeness, neutrality, and free from error. Enhancing qualities include comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and 
understandability. The elements consist of Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Investment by owners, Distribution to owners, Comprehensive income, Revenues, Expenses, Gains, and losses.
The third level crosses the top of the triangle with three components representing the “how” or implementation of the standards. The components encompass the Recognition, Measurement, and Disclosure Concepts of accounting. Three arrows point down to concepts that read, Assumptions, Principles, and Constraint.
Assumptions include Economic entity, Going concern, Monetary unit, and Periodicity. Principles include Measurement, Revenue recognition, Expense recognition, and Full disclosure. The constraint consists of cost.

              >Beyond touting nonfinancial measures to investors (see the “What
              Do the Numbers Mean?” box entitled “Show Me the Earnings!”), many
              companies increasingly promote the performance of their companies
              through the reporting of various “pro forma” earnings measures.
              Pro forma measures are standard measures (such as earnings) that
              companies adjust, usually for unusual or non-recurring items. Such
              adjustments make the numbers more comparable to numbers reported
              in periods without these unusual or non-recurring items.
            </p>
            <p data-index="1008">
              However, rather than increasing comparability, it appears that
              some companies use pro forma reporting to accentuate the positive
              in their results. Examples include
              <span class="red" data-index="1009"

              expense.

              transformed an operating loss into a pro forma profit by adding
              back expenses for depreciation and amortization of intangible
              assets.

            <p data-index="1018">
              And taking a more macro look, the following table shows the
              difference between pro forma (non-GAAP) and GAAP earnings per
              share for the three main Standard &amp; Poor’s stock indexes for a
              recent year.
            </p>
            <p data-index="1019">
              What this table shows is that the S&amp;P 600 is especially biased
              with a variance of 32.4% (non-GAAP higher than GAAP). Lynn Turner,
              former chief accountant at the SEC, calls such earnings measures
              EBS—“Everything but Bad Stuff.” To provide investors a more
              complete picture of company profitability, not the story preferred
              by management, the SEC issued Regulation G (REG G). For example,
              REG G (and related item 10E) requires companies to reconcile
              non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP, thereby giving investors a
              roadmap to analyze the adjustments that companies make to their
              GAAP numbers to arrive at pro forma results.

            During the current year, Jeremy Meadow Corporation changed its
            policy in regard to expensing purchases of small tools. In the past,
            it had expensed these purchases because they amounted to less than
            2% of net income. Now, the president has decided that the company
            should follow a policy of capitalization and subsequent
            depreciation. It is expected that purchases of small tools will not
            fluctuate greatly from year to year.

            The company constructed a warehouse at a cost of $1,000,000. It had
            been depreciating the asset on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
            In the current year, the controller doubled depreciation expense
            because the replacement cost of the warehouse had increased
            significantly.

            On July 15 of the current year, Jeremy Meadow Corporation purchased
            an undeveloped tract of land at a cost of $320,000. The company
            spent $80,000 in subdividing the land and getting it ready for sale.
            An appraisal of the property at the end of the year indicated that
            the land was now worth $500,000. Although none of the lots were
            sold, the company recognized revenue of $180,000, less related
            expenses of $80,000, for a net income on the project of $100,000.

            For a number of years, the company used the FIFO method for
            inventory valuation purposes. During the current year, the president
            noted that all the other companies in the industry had switched to
            the LIFO method. The company decided not to switch to LIFO because
            net income would decrease $830,000.

          From the facts, it is difficult to determine whether to agree or
          disagree. Consistency, of course, is violated in this situation
          although its violation may not be material. Furthermore, the change of
          accounting policies regarding the treatment of small tools cannot be
          judged good or bad but would depend on the circumstances. In this
          case, it seems that the result will be approximately the same whether
          the corporation capitalizes and expenses, or simply expenses each
          period, since the purchases are fairly uniform. Perhaps from a cost
          standpoint (expediency), it might be best to continue the present
          policy rather than become involved in detailed depreciation schedules,
          assuming that purchases remain fairly uniform. On the other hand, the
          president may believe there is a significant unrecorded asset that
          should be shown on the balance sheet. If such is the case,
          capitalization and subsequent depreciation would be more appropriate.

          Disagree. At the present time, accountants do not recognize price
          level or current value adjustments in the accounts. Hence, it is
          misleading to deviate from the historical cost principle because
          conjecture or opinion can take place. Also, depreciation is not so
          much a matter of valuation as it is a means of cost allocation. Assets
          are not depreciated on the basis of a decline in their fair value.
          Rather, they are depreciated on the basis of a systematic charge of
          expired cost against revenues.

          Agree. The full disclosure principle recognizes that reasonable
          condensation and summarization of the details of a corporation’s
          operations and financial position are essential to readability and
          comprehension. Thus, in determining what is full disclosure, the
          accountant must decide whether omission will mislead readers of the
          financial statements. Generally, companies present only the total
          amount of cash on a balance sheet unless some special circumstance is
          involved (such as a possible restriction on the use of the cash). In
          most cases, however, the company’s presentation would be considered
          appropriate and in accordance with the full disclosure principle.
        </p>
        <p class="latin2" data-index="1239">
          <span class="label" data-index="1240"

          >
          Disagree. The historical cost principle indicates that companies
          account for assets and liabilities on the basis of cost. If sales
          value were selected, for example, it would be extremely difficult to
          establish an appraisal value for the given item without selling it.
          Note, too, that the revenue recognition principle provides guidance on
          when revenue should be recognized. Revenue should be recognized when
          the performance obligation is satisfied. In this case, the revenue was
          not recognized because the critical event, “sale of the land with
          transfer to the buyer,” had not occurred.
        </p>
        <p class="latin2" data-index="1242">
          <span class="label" data-index="1243"

          >
          From the facts, it is difficult to determine whether to agree or
          disagree with the president. The president’s approach is not a
          violation of any principle. Consistency requires that accounting
          entities give accountable events the same accounting treatment from
          period to period for a given business enterprise. It says nothing
          concerning consistency of accounting principles among business
          enterprises. From a comparability viewpoint, it might be useful to
          report the information on a LIFO basis. But, as indicated above, there
          is no requirement to do so.

          During the year, the company sold certain equipment for $285,000,
          recognizing a gain of $69,000. Because the controller believed that

          the gain and amortize it over the life of any new equipment purchased.

          has some questions regarding the theoretical framework in which GAAP
          is set. He knows that the FASB and other predecessor organizations
          have attempted to develop a conceptual framework for accounting theory
          formulation. Yet, Wayne’s supervisors have indicated that these
          theoretical frameworks have little value in the practical sense (i.e.,
          in the real world). Wayne did notice that accounting rules seem to be
          established after the fact rather than before. He thought this
          indicated a lack of theory structure but never really questioned the
          process at school because he was too busy doing the homework.

          Wayne feels that some of his anxiety about accounting theory and

          them in light of his current work. By doing this, he hopes to develop
          an appropriate connection between theory and practice.

          William Murray achieved one of his life-long dreams by opening his own

          $20,000 of his own savings in the business. He paid $6,000 cash to
          have a small building constructed to house the operations and spent
          $800 on golf clubs, golf balls, and yardage signs. Murray leased 4
          acres of land at a cost of $1,000 per month. (He paid the first
          month’s rent in cash.) During the first month, advertising costs
          totaled $750, of which $150 was unpaid at the end of the month. Murray
          paid his three nephews $400 for retrieving golf balls. He deposited in
          the company’s bank account all revenues from customers ($4,700). On
          May 15, Murray withdrew $800 in cash for personal use. On May 31, the
          company received a utility bill for $100 but did not immediately pay
          it. On May 31, the balance in the company bank account was $15,100.

        The IASB and the FASB originally planned to develop a common conceptual

          Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information</i

        complete other parts of the conceptual framework (which it did in 2018).
        The FASB did not join in on this effort although it is advancing its own
        work plan to modify its existing conceptual framework as well. Both
        Boards have the same objective, that is, to develop a conceptual
        framework consisting of standards that are principles-based and
        internally consistent, thereby leading to the most useful financial
        reporting. Hopefully, the two Boards will eventually agree on the key
        components of a common conceptual framework.

        The FASB now faces a difficult task in attempting to update, modify, and
        complete a converged conceptual framework. There are many difficult

        Hopefully, the recently completed IASB conceptual framework will provide
        many useful concepts for the FASB in helping it to complete the revision
        process for its conceptual framework. We are optimistic that the revised
        conceptual framework will be a significant improvement over its
        predecessors and will lead to standards that will help financial
        statement users to make better decisions.

          develops accounting standards for many international companies. The
          IASB also has developed a conceptual framework to help guide the
          setting of accounting standards. While the FASB and IASB have issued
          converged concepts statements on the objective and qualitative
          characteristics, other parts of their frameworks differ.

          pass through the same due process (discussion paper, public hearing,

          standards for any particular measurement or disclosure issue, and
          nothing in the framework overrides any specific FASB pronouncement
          that is included in the Codification.

          means when in doubt, choose the solution that will be least likely to
          overstate assets or income and/or understate liabilities or expenses.
          The conceptual framework indicates that prudence or conservatism
          generally is in conflict with the quality of neutrality. This is
          because being prudent or conservative likely leads to a bias in the
          reported financial position and financial performance. In fact,
          introducing biased understatement of assets (or overstatement of
          liabilities) in one period frequently leads to overstating financial
          performance in later periods—a result that cannot be described as
          prudent. This is inconsistent with neutrality, which encompasses
          freedom from bias. Accordingly, the conceptual framework does not
          include prudence or conservatism as desirable qualities of financial
          reporting information. See “Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of
          Useful Financial Information,”

          “outer edges” of companies is now harder. Public companies often
          consist of multiple public subsidiaries, each with joint ventures,
          licensing arrangements, and other affiliations. Increasingly,
          companies form and dissolve joint ventures or customer-supplier
          relationships in a matter of months or weeks. These “virtual
          companies” raise accounting issues about how to account for the
          entity. As discussed in footnote 13, the FASB is addressing these
          issues in the entity phase of its conceptual framework project.

          requires that companies use the liquidation basis of accounting when
          liquidation is imminent (when either a plan for liquidation has been
          approved or a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces,
          such as involuntary bankruptcy). If liquidation accounting is used,
          financial statements should reflect relevant information about a
          company’s resources and obligations in liquidation by measuring and
          presenting assets and liabilities at the amount of cash or other
          consideration that the company expects to collect or pay in
          liquidation, along with additional disclosures about the plan for
          liquidation, the methods and significant assumptions used to measure
          assets and liabilities, the type and amount of costs and income
          accrued, and the expected duration of liquidation.

          debate about the conceptual validity of the matching principle. A
          major concern is that matching permits companies to defer certain
          costs and treat them as assets on the balance sheet. In fact, these
          costs may not have future benefits. If abused, this principle permits
          the balance sheet to become a “dumping ground” for unmatched costs.
