            ­financial reporting has long been the most robust and transparent

        A recent report says it best: “Accounting information is central to the
        functioning of international capital markets and to managing small
        businesses, conducting effective government, understanding business
        processes, and . . . how economic decisions are made. . . . . Across the
        globe, a common characteristic of economies that flourish is the
        presence of reliable accounting information.”&nbsp;

        Many in the United States take pride in our system of financial
        reporting as being the most robust and transparent in the world. Yet
        even with continued improvement in financial reporting over the last 20
        years, we have had many accounting scandals occurring at companies like
        <span class="red" data-index="56">Enron</span>,
        <span class="red" data-index="57">AIG</span>,
        <span class="red" data-index="58">WorldCom</span>, and
        <span class="red" data-index="59">Lehman</span>, as well as the
        financial crisis of 2008. However, as with many difficulties, there is
        often a silver lining. As one commentator noted, “Those accounting
        scandals were a crisis we should be thankful for; we got through it and
        a law was passed (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and it works.” A key feature of
        this law is that company executives are required to attest to the
        accuracy of their companies’ financial statements.&nbsp;

        To better understand where we are, the Center for Audit Quality conducts
        a yearly survey that measures investor confidence in such categories as
        U.S. capital markets, audited financial information, and U.S publicly
        traded companies. As shown in the chart, the results indicate that the
        2008 financial crisis took a bite out of investor confidence. However,
        investor confidence has rebounded dramatically and is at its highest
        level since the survey was initiated—perhaps because of
        Sarbanes-Oxley.&nbsp;

        company’s market value that can be attributed to accounting book value
        has declined significantly from the days of a bricks-and-mortar economy.

          >how to deliver all of this information in a more timely manner</span
        >. In a world where messages can be sent across the world in a blink of

            it incurs them rather than when it pays them. Under accrual

          criticism, most members of the financial community recognize them as

            At the time the SEC was created, no group—public or private—issued
            accounting standards. The SEC encouraged the creation of a private
            standard-setting body because it believed that the private sector
            had the appropriate resources and talent to achieve this daunting
            task. As a result, accounting standards have developed in the
            private sector either through the American Institute of Certified
            Public Accountants (AICPA) or the Financial Accounting Standards

            accounting for investments in debt and equity securities and the
            reporting of derivative instruments. In still other situations, the
            SEC communicates problems to the FASB, responds to FASB exposure

            However, when the private sector fails to address accounting
            problems as quickly as the SEC would like, the partnership between
            the SEC and the private sector can be strained. This occurred in the
            deliberations on the accounting for business combinations and
            intangible assets. It is also highlighted by concerns over the

            As we indicated earlier, companies listed on a stock exchange must
            submit their financial statements to the SEC. If the SEC believes
            that an accounting or disclosure irregularity exists regarding the
            form or content of the financial statements, it sends a deficiency
            letter to the company. Companies usually resolve these deficiency
            letters quickly. If disagreement continues, the SEC may issue a
            “stop order,” which prevents the registrant from issuing or trading
            securities on the exchanges. The Department of Justice may also file
            criminal charges for violations of certain laws. The SEC process,
            private sector initiatives, and civil and criminal litigation help
            to ensure the integrity of financial reporting for public companies.

            Unfortunately, the APB came under fire early, charged with lack of
            productivity and failing to act promptly to correct alleged
            accounting abuses. Later, the APB tackled numerous thorny accounting
            issues, only to meet a buzz saw of opposition from industry and CPA
            firms. It also ran into occasional governmental interference. In
            1971, the accounting profession’s leaders, anxious to avoid
            governmental rule-making, appointed a Study Group on Establishment

            to the AICPA Council in the spring of 1972, which led to the
            replacement of the APB with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
            (FASB) in 1973.

            In establishing financial accounting standards, the FASB relies on
            two basic premises. (1) The FASB should be responsive to the needs
            and viewpoints of the entire economic community, not just the public
            accounting profession. (2) It should operate in full view of the
            public through a “due process” system that gives interested persons
            ample opportunity to make their views known. To ensure the
            achievement of these goals, the FASB follows specific steps to
            develop a typical FASB pronouncement, as

              accounting standards, other than standards issued by the SEC. (We
              discuss the Codification in more detail later in the chapter.)
              Each Update explains how the Codification has been amended and
              also includes information to help the reader understand the
              changes and when those changes will be effective. Common forms of
              amendments are accounting standards issued that address a broad
              area of accounting practice (such as the accounting for leases) or
              interpretations that modify or extend existing standards. Prior
              standard-setters such as the APB also issued interpretations of
              APB Opinions.

              guidance within the framework of the Codification to reduce
              diversity in practice on a timely basis. The EITF was designed to
              minimize the need for the FASB to spend time and effort addressing
              narrow implementation, application, or other emerging issues that
              can be analyzed within existing GAAP. Examples include accounting
              for pension plan terminations, revenue from barter transactions by
              Internet companies, and excessive amounts paid to takeover
              specialists. The EITF also provided timely guidance for the
              accounting for loans and investments in the wake of the credit
              crisis.
            </p>
            <p data-index="527">
              The EITF helps the FASB in many ways. The EITF identifies
              controversial accounting problems as they arise. The EITF
              determines whether it can quickly resolve them or whether to
              involve the FASB in solving them. In essence, it becomes a
              “problem filter” for the FASB. Thus, the FASB will hopefully work
              on more pervasive long-term problems, while the EITF deals with
              short-term emerging issues.
            </p>
            <p data-index="528">
              We cannot overestimate the importance of the EITF. In one year,
              for example, the task force examined 61 emerging financial
              reporting issues and arrived at a consensus on approximately 75
              percent of them. The FASB reviews and approves all EITF
              consensuses. And the SEC indicated that it will view consensus
              solutions as preferred accounting. Further, it requires persuasive
              justification for departing from them.

            purpose of serving the public interest by improving financial
            reporting. FinREC also issues audit and accounting guides, which

          Historically, the documents that comprised GAAP varied in format,
          completeness, and structure. In some cases, these documents were
          inconsistent and difficult to interpret. As a result, financial
          statement preparers sometimes were not sure whether they had the right
          GAAP. Determining what was authoritative and what was not became
          difficult.

          (or more simply, “the Codification”). The FASB’s primary goal in
          developing the Codification is to provide in one place all the
          authoritative literature related to a particular topic. This will
          simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. generally accepted
          accounting principles. The Codification establishes the way GAAP is
          documented, presented, and updated. It explains what GAAP is and
          eliminates nonessential information such as redundant document
          summaries, basis for conclusion sections, and historical content. In
          short, the Codification integrates and synthesizes existing GAAP; it
          does not create new GAAP. It creates one level of GAAP, which is
          considered authoritative. All other accounting literature is
          considered non-authoritative.<sup data-index="620"

The chart begins with topic 310, receivables. A topic provides a collection of related guidance on a given subject, such as receivables or leases. Two arrows point to subtopic 10, overall, and to subtopic 40, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors. Subtopics are a subset of a topic and distinguished by type or scope. For example, overall and troubled-debt restructurings are two subtopics of receivables.
Arrows lead from subtopic 10 overall to section 30, Initial Management and to section 35, Subsequent Measurement. Sections indicate the type of content in a subtopic, such as initial measurement. In some cases, subsections are used but not numbered.
An arrow from Section 35, Subsequent Measurement leads to paragraph 47, Loans and Trade Receivables Not Held For Sale. Paragraphs are the level where you will find the substantive content related to the issue researched. All other levels exist essentially to find the material related to the paragraph level content.

          research accounting issues as well as minimize the risk of
          noncompliance with GAAP, sometimes substantially. In addition, the

              No recent accounting issue better illustrates the economic
              consequences of accounting than the current debate over the use of
              fair value accounting for financial assets. Both the FASB and the
              International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have standards
              requiring the use of fair value accounting for financial assets,
              such as investments and other financial instruments. Fair value
              provides the most relevant and reliable information for investors
              about these assets and liabilities. However, in the wake of the
              credit crisis of 2008, some countries, their central banks, and
              bank regulators want to suspend fair value accounting, based on
              concerns that use of fair value accounting, which calls for
              recording significant losses on poorly performing loans and
              investments, could scare investors and depositors and lead to a
              “run on the bank.”
            </p>
            <p data-index="721">
              For example, in 2009, Congress ordered the FASB to change its
              accounting rules so as to reduce the losses banks reported, as the
              values of their securities had crumbled. These ­changes were
              generally supported by banks. But these changes produced a strong
              reaction from some investors, with one investor group complaining
              that the changes would “effectively gut the transparent
              application of fair value measurement.” The group also says
              suspending fair value accounting would delay the recovery of the
              banking system.

            <p data-index="722">
              Such political pressure on accounting standard-setters is not
              confined to the United States. For example, in 2008 French
              President Nicolas Sarkozy urged his European Union counterparts to
              back changes to accounting rules and give banks and insurers some
              breathing space amid the market turmoil. And more recently,
              international finance ministers are urging the FASB and IASB to
              accelerate their work on accounting ­standards, including the fair
              value guidance for financial instruments.
            </p>
            <p data-index="723">
              Most recently, IASB chair Hans Hoogervorst indicated that work
              remains to be done in the fair value debate and that “the
              dichotomy between historical cost and fair value is not as stark
              as one would expect.” Hoogervorst noted that while historical cost
              is to some extent based on fair value, it needs a degree of
              current measurement to maintain its relevance. It is not free from

              stable. Moreover, historical cost is also vulnerable to abuse. In
              sum, all the vulnerabilities that are often attributed to fair
              value accounting can be equally pertinent to historical cost.
            </p>
            <p data-index="725">
              It is unclear whether these political pressures will have an
              effect on fair value accounting, but there is no question that the
              issue has stirred significant worldwide political debate. In
              short, the numbers have consequences.

            investments in stocks and bonds, debt obligations, and derivatives
            at fair value, or companies show information related to fair values
            in the notes to the financial statements. The FASB and the IASB have
            a converged standard on fair value measures, which should enhance
            the usefulness of fair value measures in financial statements.

          <li data-index="830">
            The FASB is now working on projects that address disclosure
            effectiveness, a reporting framework for non-public companies, and a
            simplification initiative. The projects could go a long way toward
            addressing complexity and understandability of the information in
            financial statements, allowing for more-effective, less-complex, and
            flexible reporting to meet the needs of investors.

            Already 120 countries use IFRS, and the European Union now requires
            all listed companies in Europe (over 7,000 companies) to use it.
            Most parties recognize that global markets will best be served if
            only one set of accounting standards is used. For example, the FASB
            and the IASB formalized their commitment to the convergence of GAAP
            and IFRS by issuing a memorandum of understanding (often referred to
            as the Norwalk agreement). The two Boards agreed to use their best
            efforts to:
          </p>
          <ul data-index="869">
            <li data-index="870">
              Make their existing financial reporting standards fully compatible

          </ul>
          <p data-index="872">
            As a result of this agreement, the two Boards identified a number of
            short-term and long-term projects that would lead to convergence.
            For example, one short-term project was for the FASB to issue a rule
            that permits a fair value option for financial instruments. This
            rule was issued in 2007, and now the FASB and the IASB follow the
            same accounting in this area. Conversely, the IASB completed a
            project related to borrowing costs, which makes IFRS consistent with
            GAAP. Long-term convergence projects relate to such issues as
            revenue recognition and leases.

            standards, which result in comparable reporting. By doing so,

            of financial reporting standards in the world for the foreseeable
            future. For example, the United States is reluctant to fully adopt
            IFRS. As the chief accountant of the SEC noted, there is virtually
            no support for having the SEC mandate IFRS for public companies, and
            there is little support for the SEC to provide an option allowing
            U.S. companies to prepare their financial statements under IFRS. In
            addition, both the FASB and the IASB seem to be taking different
            approaches to various financial reporting problems, such as the
            measurement and recognition of financial instruments. Further, the
            IASB has decided to move forward on the conceptual framework project
            independent of the FASB.

                One of the more difficult issues related to convergence and
                international accounting standards is that countries have
                different cultures and customs. For example, the former chair of
                the IASB explained it this way regarding Europe:
              </p>
              <blockquote data-index="902">
                <p data-index="903">
                  “In the U.K. everything is permitted unless it is prohibited.
                  In Germany, it is the other way around; everything is
                  prohibited unless it is permitted. In the Netherlands,
                  everything is prohibited even if it is permitted. And in
                  France, everything is permitted even if it is prohibited. Add
                  in countries like Japan, the United States and China, it
                  becomes very difficult to meet the needs of each of these

        <p data-index="912">
          Robert Sack, a noted commentator on the subject of accounting ethics,
          observed, “Based on my experience, new graduates tend to be idealistic
          . . . thank goodness for that! Still it is very dangerous to think
          that your armor is all in place and say to yourself, ’I would have
          never given in to that.’ The pressures don’t explode on us; they
          build, and we often don’t recognize them until they have us.”
        </p>
        <p data-index="913">
          These observations are particularly appropriate for anyone entering
          the business world. In accounting, as in other areas of business, we
          frequently encounter ethical dilemmas. Some of these dilemmas are
          simple and easy to resolve. However, many are not, requiring difficult
          choices among allowable alternatives.
        </p>
        <p data-index="914">
          Companies that concentrate on “maximizing the bottom line,” “facing
          the challenges of competition,” and “stressing short-term results”
          place accountants in an environment of conflict and pressure. Basic
          questions such as, “Is this way of communicating financial information
          good or bad?” “Is it right or wrong?” and “What should I do in this
          circumstance?” cannot always be answered by simply adhering to GAAP or
          following the rules of the profession. Technical competence is not
          enough when encountering ethical decisions.
        </p>
        <p data-index="915">
          Doing the right thing is not always easy or obvious. The pressures “to
          bend the rules,” “to play the game,” or “to just ignore it” can be
          considerable. For example, “Will my decision affect my job performance
          negatively?” “Will my superiors be upset?” and “Will my colleagues be
          unhappy with me?” are often questions business people face in making a
          tough ethical decision. The decision is more difficult because there
          is no comprehensive ethical system to provide guidelines.
        </p>
        <p data-index="916">
          Time, job, client, personal, and peer pressures can complicate the
          process of ethical sensitivity and selection among alternatives.

        </h3>
        <p data-index="921">
          Bob Herz, a former FASB chair, believes that there are three
          fundamental considerations the FASB must keep in mind in its
          rule-making activities: (1) improvement in financial reporting, (2)
          simplification of the accounting literature and the rule-making
          process, and (3) international convergence. These are notable
          objectives, and the Board is making good progress on all three
          dimensions. Issues such as off-balance-sheet financing, measurement of
          fair values, enhanced criteria for revenue recognition, and stock
          option accounting are examples of where the Board has exerted
          leadership. Improvements in financial reporting should follow.
        </p>
        <p data-index="922">
          Also, the Board is making it easier to understand what GAAP is. GAAP
          has been
          <span data-index="923"
            >contained in a number of different documents. The lack of a single
            source makes it dif</span
          >ficult to access and understand generally accepted principles. As
          discussed earlier, the Codification now organizes existing GAAP by
          accounting topic regardless of its source (FASB Statements, APB
          Opinions, and so on). The codified standards are then considered to be
          GAAP and to be authoritative. All other literature will be considered
          nonauthoritative.

          One major challenge is that user groups may want particular economic
          events accounted for or reported in a particular way, and they fight
          hard to get what they want. They especially target the FASB to
          influence changes in existing GAAP and in the development of new
          rules. A second challenge is that financial reports fail to provide
          (1) some key performance measures widely used by management, (2)
          forward-looking information needed by investors and creditors, (3)
          sufficient

          called on for moral ­discernment and ethical decision-making.
          Decisions sometimes are difficult because a public consensus has not
          emerged to formulate a comprehensive ethical system that provides
          guidelines in making ethical judgments.

          loan-backed investments) at fair value instead of cost, large losses
          would have been reported earlier. This would have signaled regulators

          acknowledged that he was aware we had problems with the entries, David
          Myers had informed him, and we were considering resigning.
        </p>
        <p data-index="1552">
          He said that he respected our concerns but that we weren’t being asked
          to do anything that he believed was wrong. He mentioned that he
          acknowledged that the company had lost focus quite a bit due to the
          preparations for the Sprint merger, and that he was putting plans in
          place and projects in place to try to determine where the problems
          were, why the costs were so high.
        </p>
        <p data-index="1553">
          He did say he believed that the initial statements that we produced,
          that the line costs in those statements could not have been as high as
          they were, that he believed something was wrong and there was no way
          that the costs were that high.

        <p data-index="1554">
          I informed him that I didn’t believe the entry we were being asked to
          do was right, that I was scared, and I didn’t want to put myself in a
          position of going to jail for him or the company. He responded that

          He asked that I stay, don’t jump off the plane, let him land it
          softly, that’s basically how he put it. And he mentioned that he had a

            approach as a final standard without exposing it for public comment

            speed with which it has been developed and the significant changes

            weakening of companies’ ability to manage risk, and the adverse
            control implications of implementing costly and complex new rules
            imposed at the same time as other major initiatives, including the
            Year 2000 issues and a single European currency. We believe that
            these crucial issues must be considered, if not by the FASB, then by
            the Securities and Exchange Commission, other regulatory agencies,
            or Congress.
          </p>
          <p data-index="1636">
            We believe it is essential that the FASB solicit all comments in
            order to identify and address all material issues that may exist
            before issuing a final standard. We understand the desire to bring
            this process to a prompt conclusion, but the underlying issues are
            so important to this nation’s businesses, the customers they serve
            and the economy as a whole that expediency cannot be the dominant
            consideration. As a result, we urge the FASB to expose its new
            proposal for public comment, following the established due process
            procedures that are essential to acceptance of its standards, and
            providing sufficient time to affected parties to understand and
            assess the new approach.
          </p>
          <p data-index="1637">
            We also urge the SEC to study the comments received in order to
            assess the impact that these proposed rules may have on the capital
            markets, on companies’ risk management practices, and on management
            and financial controls. These vital public policy matters deserve
            consideration as part of the Commission’s oversight
            responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p data-index="1638">
            We believe that these steps are essential if the FASB is to produce
            the best possible accounting standard while minimizing adverse
            economic effects and maintaining the competitiveness of U.S.
            businesses in the international marketplace.

            Beverly Crusher, a new staff accountant, is confused because of the
            complexities involving accounting standard-setting. Specifically,
            she is confused by the number of bodies issuing financial reporting
            standards of one kind or another and the level of authoritative
            support that can be attached to these reporting standards. Beverly
            decides that she must review the environment in which accounting
            standards are set, if she is to increase her understanding of the
            accounting profession.

            the development of GAAP. However, she remembers that her instructor
            placed little emphasis on these chapters.

          GAAP is more detailed or rules-based. IFRS tends to simpler and more
          flexible in its accounting and disclosure requirements. The difference
          in approach has resulted in a debate about the merits of

          Differences between GAAP and IFRS should not be surprising because
          standard-setters have developed standards in response to different

        World markets are increasingly intertwined. International consumers
        drive Japanese cars, wear Italian shoes and Scottish woolens, drink
        Brazilian coffee and Indian tea, eat Swiss chocolate bars, sit on Danish
        furniture, watch U.S. movies, and use Arabian oil. The tremendous
        variety and volume of both exported and imported goods indicates the
        extensive involvement in international trade—for many companies, the
        world is their market. To provide some indication of the extent of

        As capital markets are increasingly integrated, companies have greater
        flexibility in deciding where to raise capital. In the absence of market
        integration, there can be company-specific factors that make it cheaper
        to raise capital and list/trade securities in one location versus
        another. With the integration of capital markets, the automatic linkage
        between the location of the company and location of the capital market
        is loosening. As a result, companies have expanded choices of where to
        raise capital, either equity or debt. The move toward adoption of
        International Financial Reporting Standards has and will continue to
        facilitate this movement.

        For many years, many nations have relied on their own standard-setting
        organizations. For example, Canada has the Accounting Standards Board,
        Japan has the Accounting Standards Board of Japan, Germany has the
        German Accounting Standards Committee, and the United States has the
        Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The standards issued by
        these organizations are sometimes principles-based, rules-based,
        tax-oriented, or business-based. In other words, they often differ in
        concept and objective. Starting in 2000, two major standard-setting
        bodies have emerged as the primary standard-setting bodies in the world.
        One organization is based in London, United Kingdom, and is called the

        are also considered authoritative and must be followed. These
        interpretations cover (1) newly identified financial reporting issues
        not specifically dealt with in IFRS, and (2) issues where unsatisfactory
        or conflicting interpretations have developed, or seem likely to
        develop, in the absence of authoritative guidance. The IFRIC has issued
        over 20 of these interpretations to date. In keeping with the IASB’s own
        approach to setting standards, the IFRIC applies a principles-based
        approach in providing interpretative guidance. To this end, the IFRIC
        looks first to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
        Financial Statements as the foundation for formulating a consensus. It
        then looks to the principles articulated in the applicable standard, if
        any, to develop its interpretative guidance and to determine that the
        proposed guidance does not conflict with provisions in IFRS.
      </p>
      <p data-index="2074">
        IFRIC helps the IASB in many ways. For example, emerging issues often
        attract public attention. If not resolved quickly, they can lead to
        financial crises and scandal. They can also undercut public confidence
        in current reporting practices. Similar to the EITF in the United
        States, IFRIC can address controversial accounting problems as they
        arise. It determines whether it can resolve them or whether to involve
        the IASB in solving them. In essence, it becomes a “problem filter” for
        the IASB. Thus, the IASB will hopefully work on more pervasive long-term
        problems, while the IFRIC deals with short-term emerging issues.

      <p data-index="2077">
        Because it is a private organization, the IASB has no regulatory mandate
        and therefore no enforcement mechanism. Similar to the U.S. setting, in
        which the Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the use of FASB
        standards for public companies, the IASB relies on other regulators to
        enforce the use of its standards. For example, effective January 1,
        2005, the European Union required publicly traded member country
        companies to use IFRS.
      </p>
      <p data-index="2078">
        Certain changes have been implemented with respect to use of IFRS in the
        United States. For example, under American Institute of Certified Public
        Accountants (AICPA) rules, a member of the AICPA can only report on
        financial statements prepared in accordance with standards promulgated
        by standard-setting bodies designated by the AICPA Council. In May 2008,
        the AICPA Council voted to designate the IASB in London as an
        international accounting standard-setter for purposes of establishing
        international financial accounting and reporting principles, and to make
        related amendments to its rules to provide AICPA members with the option
        to use IFRS.

        The SEC has recognized that the establishment of a single, widely
        accepted set of high-quality accounting standards benefits both global
        capital markets and U.S. investors. U.S. investors will make

        financial information from U.S. companies that is more comparable to the

          The main thrust of the report is that we will have to wait and see for

          question of whether transitioning to IFRS is in the best interests of
          the U.S. securities markets generally and U.S. investors specifically,
          it appears that it is unlikely companies would be required to change
          to IFRS in the near future. Rather, the SEC staff has suggested

        The approach to incorporation is an “endorsement approach.” Rather than
        adopting IFRS at a point in time, the endorsement approach specifies
        that the FASB and IASB continue to collaborate to align GAAP and IFRS.
        As a result, standards (which are also IFRS) could be incorporated into

        addition to the endorsement framework, the SEC chief accountant posed
        the possible development of rules that would allow U.S. companies to
        report IFRS-based financial information in addition to the GAAP-based
        information that they use for purposes of SEC filings. The rules would
        be needed because such additional disclosures currently would be
        considered a “non-GAAP” financial measure for a domestic issuer. This
        change in rules would permit companies who wish to ­report IFRS-based
        information to do so without affecting their GAAP-based information.
        While there has been little support for this IFRS option, the chief
        accountant is open to approaches that complement the convergence efforts
        of the FASB and the IASB, indicating that, “Whatever the ultimate result
        is with respect to IFRS in the U.S., the Boards should continue to
        strive where practicable for aligned high-quality global standards.”

        Both the IASB and the FASB are hard at work developing standards that
        will lead to the elimination of major differences in the way certain
        transactions are accounted for and reported. In fact, beginning in 2010,
        the IASB (and the FASB on its joint projects with the IASB) started its
        policy of phasing in adoption of new major standards over several years.
        The major reason for this policy is to provide companies time to
        translate and implement international standards into practice. Much has
        happened in a very short period of time in the international accounting
        environment. While adoption of IFRS in the United States is an unlikely
        avenue to achieve a single set of high-quality accounting standards,
        there continues to be strong support for the Boards to continue their
        work to narrow the differences between GAAP and IFRS.

          The term <i data-index="2319">cash flows</i> also frequently means
          cash obtained by borrowing and used to repay borrowing, cash used for

          investments, and cash contributed by or distributed to owners.

          One writer described the relationship of the FASB and SEC and the
          development of financial reporting standards using the analogy of a
          pearl. The pearl (a financial reporting standard) “is formed by the
          reaction of certain oysters (FASB) to an irritant (the SEC)—usually a
          grain of sand—that becomes embedded inside the shell. The oyster coats
          this grain with layers of nacre, and ultimately a pearl is formed. The
          pearl is a joint result of the irritant (SEC) and oyster (FASB);
          without both, it cannot be created.” John C. Burton, “Government
          Regulation of Accounting and Information,”
          <i data-index="2330">Journal of Accountancy</i> (June 1982).

          the Not-for-Profit Advisor Committee (NAC), and the recently
          established Private Company Council (PCC), share their views and
          experience with the FASB on matters related to projects on the Board’s

          Access to the full functionality of the Codification Research System
          requires a subscription; reduced-price academic access is available
          through the American Accounting Association. Prior to the
          Codification, the profession relied on
          <i data-index="2340">FASB 162</i>, “The Hierarchy of Generally
          Accepted Accounting Principles,” which defined the meaning of
          generally accepted accounting principles. In that document, certain
          documents were deemed more authoritative than others, which led to
          various levels of GAAP. Fortunately, the Codification does not have
          different levels of GAAP.
