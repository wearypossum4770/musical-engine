A chart at the bottom contains four columns containing topics pertaining to Full Disclosure in Financial Reporting. The first column is titled as the Full Disclosure Principle, and includes an increase in reporting requirements, differential disclosure, and notes to the financial statements. The second section is Disclosure Issues, which covers special transactions or events, post-balance-sheet events, diversified companies, and interim reports.

<p data-index="58">Here are excerpts from leading experts regarding the importance of high-quality financial reporting:</p>
<blockquote data-index="59">
<p data-index="60"><b data-index="61">Warren E. Buffett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,</b> <span class="red" data-index="62"><b data-index="63">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</b></span><b data-index="64">:</b></p>
<p data-index="65">Financial reporting for Berkshire Hathaway, and for me personally, is the beginning of every decision that we make around here in terms of capital. I'm punching out 10-Ks and 10-Qs every single day. We look at the numbers and try to evaluate the quality of the financial reporting, and then we try to figure out what that means for the bonds and stocks that we're looking at, and thinking of either buying or selling.</p>

<p data-index="71">… standards, when properly implemented, drive excellence. I can make a parallel to the pharmaceutical industry. If you look around the world at where innovations come from, economists have studied and seen that where regulatory standards are the highest is where innovation is also the highest.</p>

<p data-index="79">We are in a situation now in our society where the temptations to provide “bad” financial reporting are probably greater than they used to be. The need to get the stock price up, or to keep it up, is intense. So, the temptation to play games, the temptation to manage earnings—some of which can be legitimate and some of which cannot be—is probably greater than it used to be.</p>
<p data-index="80"><b data-index="81">Abby Joseph Cohen, President, Global Markets Institute,</b> <span class="red" data-index="82"><b data-index="83">Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</b></span><b data-index="84">:</b></p>
<p data-index="85">High-quality financial reporting is perhaps the most important thing we can expect from companies. For investors to make good decisions—whether those investors are buying stocks or bonds or making private investments—they need to know the truth. And we think that when information is as clear as possible and is reported as frequently as makes sense, investors can do their jobs as best they can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-index="86">We can also get insight into the importance of high-quality reporting based on the market assessment of companies perceived to have poor-quality reporting. At one time, <span class="red" data-index="87"><b data-index="88">Coach, Inc.</b></span> stopped reporting as separate items sales from regular stores (full price) and factory outlets. As a result, readers of its financial statements had a hard time determining the source of Coach's sales growth. Analysts were especially concerned that the less-transparent reporting might obscure slowing sales at its regular stores, as consumers cut down on luxury goods in a sluggish economy. Did Coach's stock price suffer as a result of this lower-quality reporting? You bet, as shown in the adjacent price graph.</p>

The horizontal axis contains the time period with the left portion labeled as prior year, and the right portion labeled as current year, with 12 marks for the past 12 months. The vertical axis represents the stock price ranging from $30 to $55 in increments of $5. The price in January is $51 and it declines steadily to $30 in April with a rise to $36 in May. There is an erratic decline through October hitting a low of $30. A rise occurs to $35 in November and ends about $34 in December.

<p data-index="91">In the year following the change in reporting, Coach's stock price was down 34 percent. As one analyst noted, “It's never a good sign when you reduce transparency … It's a sign of weakness.”</p>
<p data-index="92">Another example is the recent case of <span class="red" data-index="93"><b data-index="94">Sunrun</b></span>. Company insiders at this solar-energy company admitted to manipulating a key sales metric around the time of the company's initial public offering (IPO). The former managers say they were told by their superiors to hold off on internally reporting hundreds of customers who canceled their contracts during a roughly five-month period in the middle of that year. Sunrun and other solar companies typically give homeowners at least several days to back out of a contract before their home-energy systems are installed. Hiding the canceled contracts made the company's sales figures appear stronger. As one manager noted, “The big internal push was to cram as many sales as we could through the pipeline.” When discovered—shortly after the IPO—the market response was predictable. As shown in the following graph, similar to the Coach example, Sunrun's share price has declined substantially since its IPO.</p>

The price is erratic through late 2015 declining to a low of $6.50, followed be a steep increase to $14 in late 2015. A steep drop occurs a short period into 2016 with a low of $5 in February. Activity after February of 2016 is erratic ranging from $5 to $8.30 and ending 2016 at $6.30.The price remains below $6 through mid 2017.

<p data-index="121">According to the FASB Conceptual Framework, some useful information is best provided in the financial statements, and some is best provided by other means. For example, earnings and cash flows are readily available in financial statements—but investors might do better to look at comparisons to other companies in the same industry, found in news articles or brokerage house reports.</p>
<p data-index="122">FASB rules directly affect financial statements, notes to the financial statements, and supplementary information.

<p data-index="134">As <a href="c02.xhtml" data-index="135" data-section-index="12">Chapter 2</a> indicated, the profession has adopted a <span class="glossTerm" data-index="136"><span class="blue" data-index="137"><b data-index="138">full disclosure principle</b></span></span>. The full disclosure principle calls for financial reporting of <b data-index="139">any financial facts significant</b> <b data-index="140">enough to influence the judgment of an informed reader</b>. In some situations, the benefits of disclosure may be apparent but the costs uncertain. In other instances, the costs may be certain but the benefits of disclosure not as apparent.</p>
<p data-index="141"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-4" id="Page_24-4" data-index="142"></span>For example, the SEC required companies to provide expanded disclosures about their contractual obligations. In light of the off-balance-sheet accounting frauds at companies like <span class="red" data-index="143"><b data-index="144">Enron</b></span>, the benefits of these expanded disclosures seem fairly obvious to the investing public. While no one has documented the exact costs of disclosure in these situations, they would appear to be relatively small.</p>
<p data-index="145">On the other hand, the cost of disclosure can be substantial in some cases and the benefits difficult to assess. For example, at one time the <i data-index="146">Wall Street Journal</i> reported that if segment reporting were adopted, a company like <span class="red" data-index="147"><b data-index="148">Fruehauf</b></span> would have had to increase its accounting staff 50 percent, from 300 to 450 individuals. In this case, the cost of disclosure can be measured, but the benefits are less well defined (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0004" data-index="149" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0004" data-target-data-index="155"><span class="red" data-index="150"><b data-index="151">Underlying Concepts</b></span></a>).</p>

<p data-index="161">Some even argue that the reporting requirements are so detailed and substantial that users have a difficult time absorbing the information. These critics charge the profession with engaging in <b data-index="162">information overload</b>.</p>

They raise the issue of why investors were not aware of potential problems. Was the information these companies presented not comprehensible? Was it buried? Was it too technical? Was it properly presented and fully disclosed as of the financial statement date, but the situation later deteriorated? Or was it simply not there? In the following sections, we describe the elements of high-quality disclosure that will enable companies to avoid these disclosure pitfalls.</p>
<section id="c24-sec-0004" data-index="172">
<h3 data-index="173"><span class="red" data-index="174">Increase in Reporting Requirements</span></h3>
<p data-index="175">Disclosure requirements have increased substantially. One survey showed that the size of many companies' annual reports is growing in response to demands for increased transparency. For example, annual report page counts ranged from 51 pages for <span class="red" data-index="176"><b data-index="177">Tootsie Roll</b></span> to a much higher count of 166 for <span class="red" data-index="178"><b data-index="179">The</b></span> <span class="red" data-index="180"><b data-index="181">Coca Cola Company</b></span>'s annual report. One analysis from Moody's Investors Services documented “tremendous growth” in the volume of pages in company annual reports, with 75-page financial statements in the late 1990s, increasing to 120 pages in the early 2000s, and 400 pages in the most recent years. One analyst remarked, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-5" id="Page_24-5" data-index="182"></span>“that's very challenging for investors to get through….”<a href="#c24-note-0001-a" id="c24-note-0001" data-index="183" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0001-a" data-target-data-index="7127"><sup data-index="184">1</sup></a> This result is not surprising. As illustrated throughout this text, the FASB has issued many pronouncements in recent years that have substantial disclosure provisions.</p>
<p data-index="185">The reasons for this increase in disclosure requirements are varied. Some of them are:</p>
<ul data-index="186">
<li data-index="187"><span class="normal" data-index="188"><b data-index="189"><i data-index="190">Complexity of the business environment.</i></b> The increasing complexity of business operations magnifies the difficulty of distilling economic events into summarized reports. Such areas as derivatives, leasing, business combinations, pensions, financing arrangements, revenue recognition, and deferred taxes are complex. As a result, companies extensively use <b data-index="191">notes to the financial statements</b> to explain these transactions and their future effects.</span></li>
<li data-index="192"><span class="normal" data-index="193"><b data-index="194"><i data-index="195">Necessity for timely information.</i></b> Today, more than ever before, users are demanding information that is current and predictive. For example, users want more complete <b data-index="196">in­</b><b data-index="197">terim data</b>. Also, the SEC recommends enhanced fair value and sustainability disclosures.</span></li>
<li data-index="198"><span class="normal" data-index="199"><b data-index="200"><i data-index="201">Accounting as a control and monitoring device.</i></b> The government has recently sought public disclosure of such phenomena as management compensation, ­off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, and related-party transactions. An “Enronitis” concern is expressed in many of these newer disclosure requirements, and the SEC has selected accountants and auditors as the agents to assist in controlling and monitoring these concerns.</span></li>

<h3 data-index="203"><span class="red" data-index="204">Differential Disclosure</span></h3>
<p data-index="205">A trend toward <span class="glossTerm" data-index="206"><span class="blue" data-index="207"><b data-index="208">differential disclosure</b></span></span> is also occurring. For example, the SEC requires that companies report to it certain substantive information that is not found in annual reports to stockholders. Likewise, the FASB, recognizing that certain disclosure requirements are costly and unnecessary for certain companies, has eliminated reporting requirements for private (nonpublic) companies in such areas as fair value of financial instruments and segment reporting (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0005" data-index="209" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0005" data-target-data-index="215"><span class="red" data-index="210"><b data-index="211">Underlying Concepts</b></span></a>).</p>

</section>
<div class="bottom hr" data-index="219"><hr data-index="220"></div>
</aside>
<p data-index="221">Some still complain that the FASB has not gone far enough. They note that certain types of companies (small or private) should not have to follow complex GAAP requirements such as those for deferred income taxes, leases, or pensions. This issue, often referred to as “<b data-index="222">big GAAP versus little GAAP</b>,” continues to be controversial.<a href="#c24-note-0002-a" id="c24-note-0002" data-index="223" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0002-a" data-target-data-index="7133"><sup data-index="224">2</sup></a></p>
<p data-index="225">The FASB has traditionally taken the position that there should be one set of GAAP. However, due to growing concern about differential costs and benefits of a “one size fits all” reporting package, the FASB has considered providing alternative accounting treatments for private companies in areas that include recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure, effective dates, and transition methods for financial accounting standards. (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0006" data-index="226" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0006" data-target-data-index="235"><span class="green" data-index="227"><b data-index="228">Global View</b></span></a>). Since 2012, the FASB has worked with the Private Company Council (PCC) to improve the process of setting accounting standards for private companies. The PCC uses the recently developed Private Company Decision-Making Framework<a href="#c24-note-0003-a" id="c24-note-0003" data-index="229" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0003-a" data-target-data-index="7137"><sup data-index="230">3</sup></a> to evaluate whether alternatives to existing GAAP are necessary to address the needs of users of private company financial statements. The PCC also provides input to the FASB on the appropriate treatment for private companies for items under active consideration on the FASB's technical agenda. We provide an expanded discussion of the PCC and private company alternatives in <a href="a01.xhtml" data-index="231" data-section-index="35">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<hr data-index="248">
<p data-index="249">There is no better illustration of the adage that both quality and quantity are important than the issue of financial disclosure. While the full disclosure principle holds that more is better, how much more and of what form? An evaluation of this issue requires careful analysis of costs and benefits. Furthermore, as noted by one FASB member, the usefulness of expanded required disclosure also depends on users' ability to distinguish between the form of reporting (i.e., disclosed versus recognized items in financial statements). Research to date is inconclusive on this matter. So it is not just the amount but the quality.</p>
<p data-index="250">The FASB has responded by initiating a Disclosure Framework project with the goal of improving the effectiveness of disclosures in notes to financial statements. This project has resulted in a new FASB concepts statement [“Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting—<a href="c08.xhtml" data-index="251" data-section-index="18">Chapter 8</a>, Notes to Financial Statements” (August 2018)], which addresses the Board's decision process in identifying disclosures to be considered when setting disclosure requirements for individual accounting standards and evaluating existing disclosure requirements.</p>
<p data-index="252">The Disclosure Framework project has been well-received by a variety of stakeholders. Indeed some companies have ­taken up the charge to improve the readability of their financial statements, including the notes. For example, after revising and ­integrating its annual report package, <span class="red" data-index="253"><b data-index="254">General Electric (GE)</b></span> saw downloads at its website go from 2,700 to over 9,000. The FASB observes that reducing the volume of the notes to financial statements is not the primary focus of the Disclosure Framework project.&nbsp;The Board hopes that a sharper focus on important ­information, as was done at GE, will result in higher quality and reduced volume in most cases.</p>

<p data-index="266">As you know from your study of this text, notes are an integral part of the financial statements of a business enterprise. However, readers of financial statements often overlook them because they are highly technical and often appear in small print. <b data-index="267">Notes are the means of amplifying or explaining the items presented in the main body of the statements.</b> They can explain in qualitative terms information pertinent to specific financial statement items. In addition, they can provide supplementary data of a quantitative nature to expand the information in the financial statements. Notes also can explain restrictions imposed by financial arrangements or basic contractual agreements. Although notes may be technical and difficult to understand, they provide meaningful information for the user of the financial statements.<a href="#c24-note-0004-a" id="c24-note-0004" data-index="268" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0004-a" data-target-data-index="7142"><sup data-index="269">4</sup></a></p>
<h4 class="blue" data-index="270">Accounting Policies</h4>
<p data-index="271"><span class="glossTerm" data-index="272"><span class="blue" data-index="273"><b data-index="274">Accounting policies</b></span></span> are the specific accounting principles and methods a company currently uses and considers most appropriate to present fairly its financial statements. GAAP states that information about the accounting policies adopted by a reporting entity is essential for financial statement users in making economic decisions. It recommends that companies should present <b data-index="275">as an integral part of the financial statements a statement identifying the accounting policies adopted and followed by the reporting entity</b>. Companies should present the disclosure as the first note or in a separate Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section preceding the notes to the financial statements.</p>
<p data-index="276">The Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section answers such questions as: What method of depreciation is used on plant assets? What valuation method is employed on inventories? What amortization policy is followed in regard to intangible assets? How are marketing costs handled for financial reporting purposes?</p>
<p data-index="277">Refer to the financial statements and notes to the financial statements for <span class="red" data-index="278"><b data-index="279">The Procter &amp; Gamble Company</b></span> (available online) for an illustration of note disclosure of accounting policies (Note 1) and other notes accompanying the audited financial statements.</p>
<p data-index="280"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-7" id="Page_24-7" data-index="281"></span>Analysts examine carefully the summary of accounting policies to determine whether a company is using conservative or liberal accounting practices. For example, depreciating plant assets over an unusually long period of time is considered liberal. Using LIFO inventory valuation in a period of inflation is generally viewed as conservative.</p>
<p data-index="282">Companies that fail to adopt high-quality reporting policies may be heavily penalized by the market. For example, as discussed in the opening story, when <span class="red" data-index="283"><b data-index="284">Sunrun</b></span> disclosed its accounting problems, its share price dropped substantially. Investors viewed Sunrun's quality of earnings as low.</p>
<h4 class="blue" data-index="285">Common Notes</h4>
<p data-index="286">We have discussed many of the <span class="glossTerm" data-index="287"><span class="blue" data-index="288"><b data-index="289">notes to the financial statements</b></span></span> throughout this text and will discuss others more fully in this chapter. The more common notes are as follows.</p>
<aside class="feature3" data-index="290">
<div class="top hr" data-index="291"><hr data-index="292"></div>
<section id="c24-fea-0003" data-index="293">
<h4 data-index="294"><span class="red" data-index="295">Major Disclosures</span></h4>
<hr data-index="296">
<p data-index="297"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="298"><b data-index="299">Inventory.</b></span> Companies should report the basis upon which inventory amounts are stated (e.g., lower-of-cost-or-net realizable value or lower-of-cost-or-market) and the method used in determining cost (LIFO, FIFO, average-cost, etc.). Manufacturers should report, either in the balance sheet or in a separate schedule in the notes, the inventory composition (finished goods, work in process, raw materials). Unusual or significant financing arrangements relating to inventories that may require disclosure include transactions with related parties, product financing arrangements, firm purchase commitments, involuntary liquidation of LIFO inventories, and pledging of inventories as collateral. <a href="c09.xhtml" data-index="300" data-section-index="19">Chapter 9</a> illustrates these disclosures.</p>
<p data-index="301"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="302"><b data-index="303">Property, Plant, and Equipment.</b></span> Companies should state the basis of valuation for property, plant, and equipment. It is us­ually historical cost. Companies also should disclose pledges, liens, and other commitments related to these assets. In the presentation of depreciation, companies should disclose the following in the ­financial statements or in the notes: (1) depreciation expense for the period; (2) balances of major classes of depreciable assets, by nature and function, at the balance sheet date; (3) accumulated depreciation, either by major classes of depreciable assets or in total, at the balance sheet date; and (4) a general description of the method or methods used in computing depreciation with respect to major classes of depreciable assets. Finally, companies should explain any major impairments. <a href="c11.xhtml" data-index="304" data-section-index="21">Chapter 11</a> illustrates property, plant, and equipment.</p>
<p data-index="305"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="306"><b data-index="307">Creditor Claims.</b></span> Investors normally find it extremely useful to understand the nature and cost of creditor claims. However, the liabilities section in the balance sheet can provide the major types of liabilities only in the aggregate. Note schedules regarding such obligations provide additional information about how a company is financing its operations, the costs that it will bear in future periods, and the timing of future cash outflows. Financial statements must disclose for each of the five years following the date of the statements the aggregate amount of maturities and sinking fund requirements for all long-term borrowings. <a href="c14.xhtml" data-index="308" data-section-index="24">Chapter 14</a> illustrates these disclosures.</p>
<p data-index="309"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="310"><b data-index="311">Equityholders' Claims.</b></span> Many companies present in the body of the balance sheet information about equity securities: the number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding and the par ­value for each type of security. Or, companies may present such data in a note. Beyond that, a common equity note disclosure relates to contracts and senior securities outstanding that might affect the various claims of the residual equityholders. An example would be the existence of outstanding stock options, outstanding convertible debt, redeemable preferred stock, and convertible preferred stock. In addition, it is necessary to disclose certain types of restrictions currently in force. Generally, these types of restrictions involve the amount of earnings available for dividend distribution. Examples of these types of disclosures are illustrated in <a href="c15.xhtml" data-index="312" data-section-index="25">Chapter 15</a> and <a href="c16.xhtml" data-index="313" data-section-index="26">Chapter 16</a>.</p>
<p data-index="314"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="315"><b data-index="316">Contingencies and Commitments.</b></span> A company may have gain or loss contingencies that are not disclosed in the body of the financial statements. These contingencies include litigation, debt and other guarantees, possible tax assessments, renegotiation of government contracts, and sales of receivables with recourse. In addition, companies should disclose in the notes commitments that relate to dividend restrictions, purchase agreements (through-put and take-or-pay), hedge contracts, and employment contracts. Disclosures of such items are illustrated in <a href="c07.xhtml" data-index="317" data-section-index="17">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="c09.xhtml" data-index="318" data-section-index="19">Chapter 9</a>, and <a href="c13.xhtml" data-index="319" data-section-index="23">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<p data-index="320"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="321"><b data-index="322">Fair Values.</b></span> Companies that have assets or liabilities mea­sured at fair value must disclose both the cost and the fair value of all financial instruments in the notes to the financial statements. Fair value measurements may be used for many financial assets and liabilities, investments, impairments of long-lived assets, and some contingencies. Companies also provide disclosure of information that enables users to determine the extent of usage of fair value and the inputs used to implement fair value measurement. This fair value hierarchy identifies three broad levels related to the measurement of fair values (Levels 1, 2, and 3). The levels indicate the reliability of the measurement of fair value information. Appendix 17B discusses in detail fair value disclosures.</p>
<p data-index="323"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="324"><b data-index="325">Revenue.</b></span> Users carefully review revenue disclosures to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Companies disclose information about (1) contracts with customers, including significant information related to its performance obligations; (2) significant judgments and changes in these judgments that affect the determination of the transaction price, the allocation of the transaction price, and the determination of the timing of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-8" id="Page_24-8" data-index="326"></span>revenue; and (3) assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill contracts, including the amount of amortization recognized and the method used for amortization. See <a href="c18.xhtml" data-index="327" data-section-index="28">Chapter 18</a>.</p>
<p data-index="328"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="329"><b data-index="330">Deferred Taxes, Pensions, and Leases.</b></span> The FASB also ­requires extensive disclosure in the areas of deferred taxes, pensions, and leases. <a href="c19.xhtml" data-index="331" data-section-index="29">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c20.xhtml" data-index="332" data-section-index="30">Chapter 20</a>, and <a href="c21.xhtml" data-index="333" data-section-index="31">Chapter 21</a> discuss in detail each of these disclosures. Users of financial statements should carefully read notes to the financial statements for information about off-balance-sheet commitments, future financing needs, and the quality of a company's earnings.</p>
<p data-index="334"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="335"><b data-index="336">Changes in Accounting Principles.</b></span> The profession defines various types of accounting changes and establishes guides for reporting each type. Companies discuss, either in the summary of significant accounting policies or in the other notes, changes in accounting principles (as well as material changes in estimates and corrections of errors). See <a href="c22.xhtml" data-index="337" data-section-index="32">Chapter 22</a>.</p>

<p data-index="340">In earlier chapters, we discussed the disclosures listed above. The following sections of this chapter illustrate four additional disclosures of significance—special transactions or events, subsequent events, segment reporting, and interim reporting.</p>

<hr data-index="347">
<p data-index="348">Often, note disclosures are needed to give a complete picture of a company's financial position. A good example of such disclosures is the required disclosure of debt triggers that may be buried in financing arrangements. These triggers can require a company to pay off a loan immediately if the debt rating collapses; they are one of the reasons <span class="red" data-index="349"><b data-index="350">Enron</b></span> crumbled so quickly. But few Enron stockholders knew about the debt triggers until the gun had gone off. Companies are also disclosing more about their bank credit lines, liquidity, and any special-purpose entities. (The latter were major villains in the Enron drama.)</p>
<p data-index="351">How can you get better informed about note disclosures that may contain important information related to your investments? Beyond your study in this class, a good resource for understanding the contents of note disclosures is the <span class="red" data-index="352"><b data-index="353">footnoted.com</b></span> website. The site provides alerts on financial reporting practices, such as the growing trend of companies' filing financial statements late— a possible signal of accounting shenanigans. The footnoted.com site also highlights “the things companies bury in their SEC filings.” It notes that company reports are more complete of late, but only the largest companies are preparing documents that are readable. As the editor of the site noted, “[some companies] are being dragged kicking and screaming into plain English.”</p>

<p data-index="375">Related-party transactions, post-balance-sheet events, major business segments, and interim reporting can pose especially difficult problems. The accountant/­auditor who has responsibility for reporting on these types of transactions must take care to properly balance the rights of the reporting company and the needs of users of the financial ­statements.</p>

<p data-index="379"><span class="glossTerm" data-index="380"><span class="blue" data-index="381"><b data-index="382">Related-party transactions</b></span></span> arise when a company engages in transactions in which one of the parties has the ability to significantly influence the policies of the other.

Transactions such as borrowing or lending money at abnormally low or high interest rates, real estate sales at amounts that differ significantly from appraised value, exchanges of nonmonetary assets, and transactions involving enterprises that have no economic substance (“shell corporations”) suggest that related parties may be involved.</p>
<p data-index="386">In order to make adequate disclosure, companies should report the economic substance, rather than the legal form, of these transactions.

<p data-index="444">A period of several weeks, and sometimes months, may elapse after the end of the fiscal year but before the company issues financial statements. Various activities involved in closing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-10" id="Page_24-10" data-index="445"></span>the books for the period and issuing the statements all take time: counting and pricing the inventory, reconciling subsidiary ledgers with controlling accounts, preparing necessary adjusting entries, ensuring that all transactions for the period have been entered, obtaining an audit of the financial statements by independent certified public accountants, and printing the annual report. During the period between the balance sheet date and its distribution to stockholders and creditors, important transactions or other events may occur that materially affect the company's financial position or operating situation.</p>
<p data-index="446">Many who read a balance sheet believe the balance sheet condition is constant, and they project it into the future. However, readers must be told if the company has experienced a ­significant change—e.g., sold one of its plants, acquired a subsidiary, settled significant litigation, or experienced any other important event in the post-balance-sheet period. Without an explanation in a note, the reader might be misled and draw inappropriate conclusions.</p>
<p data-index="447">Two types of events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date may have a material effect on the financial statements or may need disclosure so that readers interpret these statements accurately:</p>

The objective of reporting segmented financial data is to provide information about the <b data-index="809">different types of business activities</b> in which an enterprise engages and the <b data-index="810">different economic environments</b> in which it operates.

<h4 class="blue" data-index="818">Implementing Segment Reporting</h4>
<p data-index="819">Financial statements can be disaggregated in several ways. For example, they can be disaggregated by products or services, by geography, by legal entity, or by type of customer. However, it is not feasible to provide all of that information in every set of financial statements. GAAP requires that general-purpose financial statements include selected information on a single basis of segmentation. Thus, a company can meet the segmented reporting objective by providing financial statements segmented based on how the company's operations are managed. The method chosen is referred to as the <span class="glossTerm" data-index="820"><span class="blue" data-index="821"><b data-index="822">management approach</b></span></span>. <b data-index="823">[<a href="#c24-bib-0003" id="c24-bib-0003-1" data-index="824" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-bib-0003" data-target-data-index="6595">3</a>]</b> <b data-index="825">The management approach reflects how management segments the company for making operating decisions.</b> The segments are evident from the components of the company's organization structure. These components are called <b data-index="826">operating segments</b>.</p>
<h5 data-index="827"><span class="gray" data-index="828">Identifying Operating Segments</span></h5>
<p data-index="829">An <span class="glossTerm" data-index="830"><span class="blue" data-index="831"><b data-index="832">operating segment</b></span></span> is a component of an ­enterprise:</p>
<ol class="lower-latin" style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="833">
<li data-index="834"><span class="normal" data-index="835">That engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses.</span></li>
<li data-index="836"><span class="normal" data-index="837">Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's chief operating decision-­maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources to the segment.</span></li>
<li data-index="838"><span class="normal" data-index="839">For which discrete financial information is available that is generated by or based on the internal financial reporting system.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="840">Companies may aggregate information about two or more operating segments only if the segments have the same basic characteristics in each of the following areas.</p>
<ol class="lower-latin" style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="841">
<li data-index="842"><span class="normal" data-index="843">The nature of the products and services provided.</span></li>

<li data-index="850"><span class="normal" data-index="851">If applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="852">After the company decides on the possible segments for disclosure, it makes a quantitative materiality test. This test determines whether the segment is significant enough to warrant actual disclosure. An operating segment is deemed significant, and therefore a reportable segment, if it satisfies <b data-index="853">one or more</b> of the following quantitative thresholds.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="854">

<p data-index="864">In applying these tests, the company must consider two additional factors. First, segment data must explain a significant portion of the company's business. Specifically, the segmented results must equal or exceed 75 percent of the combined sales to unaffiliated <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-14" id="Page_24-14" data-index="865"></span>customers for the entire company. This test prevents a company from providing limited information on only a few segments and lumping all the rest into one category.</p>
<p data-index="866">Second, the profession recognizes that reporting too many segments may overwhelm ­users with detailed information. The FASB decided that 10 is a reasonable upper limit for the number of segments that a company must disclose.<a href="#c24-note-0007-a" id="c24-note-0007" data-index="867" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0007-a" data-target-data-index="7158"><sup data-index="868">7</sup></a></p>

<h5 data-index="974"><span class="grey" data-index="975">Measurement Principles</span></h5>
<p data-index="976">The accounting principles that companies use for segment disclosure need not be the same as the principles they use to prepare the consolidated statements. This flexibility may at first appear inconsistent. But, preparing segment information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles would be difficult because some principles are not expected to apply at a segment level. Examples are accounting for the cost of company-wide employee benefit plans, accounting for income taxes in a company that files a consolidated tax return, and accounting for inventory on a LIFO basis if the pool includes items in more than one segment.</p>
<p data-index="977">The FASB does not require allocations of joint, common, or company-wide costs solely for external reporting purposes. <span class="glossTerm" data-index="978"><span class="blue" data-index="979"><b data-index="980">Common costs</b></span></span> are those incurred for the benefit of more than one segment and whose interrelated nature prevents a completely objective division of costs among segments. For example, the company president's salary is difficult to allocate to various segments. Allocations of common costs are inherently arbitrary and may not be meaningful. There is a presumption that if companies allocate common costs to segments, these allocations are either directly attributable or reasonably allocable.</p>
<h5 data-index="981"><span class="grey" data-index="982">Segmented Information Reported</span></h5>

Segment revenues shows a table divided into two columns, segments of business and geographic areas and sales to customers in 2017 and 2016. The values are presented as dollars in millions. The data presented is as follows: Consumer: United States, 2017, $5,565 and 2016, $5,420 is added to International sales of 8,037 and 7,887, resulting in a total of 13,602 and 13,307, respectively. Pharmaceutical: United States, 21,474 and 20,175 added to International sales of 14,782 and 13,339, resulting in a total of 36,256 and 33,464. Medical devices: United States, 12,824 and 12,266 added to International sales of 13,768 and 12,853 resulting in total of 26,592. The worldwide total is displayed as $76,450.
The next section, Segment profit, segment assets shows a table divided into three columns, marked from left to right as: list of items, pre-tax profit, and identifiable assets for the year 2017 and 2016, respectively. The data presented in the table is as follows: For pre-tax profit, the values are: Consumer: $2,524 and $2,441; Pharmaceutical: 11,083 and 12,827; Medical devices: 5,392 and 5,578; adding to give a total of 18,999 and 20,846. Expense not allocated to segments (1) of 1,326 and 1,043 respectively is subtracted from total to result in worldwide total of $17,673 and $19,803. For identifiable, the values are: Consumer: $25,030 and $23,971; Pharmaceutical: 59,450 and 27,477; Medical devices: 45,413 and 39,773; adding to give a total of 129,893 and 91,221.

The third section, Information on property, plant, and equipment shows a table divided into three columns, marked from left to right as: List of items; Additions to property, plant and equipment; and depreciation and amortization for the year 2017 and 2016, respectively. For Addition to property, plant and equipment, the values are: Consumer: $485 and $486; Pharmaceutical: 936 and 927; Medical devices: 1,566 and 1,472; adding to give segments total of 2,987 and 2,885 respectively.

<h3 data-index="1048"><span class="red" data-index="1049">Interim Reports</span></h3>
<p data-index="1050">Another source of information for the investor is interim reports. As noted earlier, <span class="glossTerm" data-index="1051"><span class="blue" data-index="1052"><b data-index="1053">interim reports</b></span></span> cover periods of less than one year. The stock exchanges, the SEC, and the accounting profession have an active interest in the presentation of interim information.</p>
<p data-index="1054">Interim reporting by public companies on a quarterly basis is a well-established and accepted practice. Analysts and investors want financial information as soon as possible, before it is old news (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0009" data-index="1055" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0009" data-target-data-index="1060"><span class="red" data-index="1056">Underlying Concepts</span></a>). However, quarterly reporting is not without critics. Today, many contend that U.S. management is too oriented to the short-term. The truth of this statement is echoed by the words of the president of a large company who decided to retire early: “I wanted to look forward to a year made up of four seasons rather than four quarters.” While some are calling for the SEC to eliminate all interim reporting requirements in response to the negative consequences of short-termism, others are calling for a common sense approach, encouraging standard-setters to consider both costs and benefits.</p>

<h4 class="blue" data-index="1213">Interim Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p data-index="1214"><b data-index="1215">Generally, companies should use the same accounting principles for interim reports and for annual reports.</b> They should recognize revenues in interim periods on the same basis as they are for annual periods. For example, if Cedars Corp. uses the percentage-of-­completion method as the basis for recognizing revenue on an annual basis, then it should use the percentage-of-completion basis for interim reports as well. Also, Cedars should treat costs <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-17" id="Page_24-17" data-index="1216"></span>directly associated with revenues (product costs, such as materials, labor and related fringe benefits, and manufacturing overhead) in the same manner for interim reports as for annual reports.</p>
<p data-index="1217">Companies should use the same inventory pricing methods (FIFO, LIFO, etc.) for interim reports and for annual reports. However, the following exceptions are appropriate at interim reporting periods.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="1218">
<li data-index="1219"><span class="normal" data-index="1220">Companies may use the gross profit method for interim inventory pricing. But they must disclose the method and adjustments to reconcile with annual inventory.</span></li>
<li data-index="1221"><span class="normal" data-index="1222">When a company liquidates LIFO inventories at an interim date and expects to replace them by year-end, cost of goods sold should include the expected cost of replacing the liquidated LIFO base, rather than give effect to the interim liquidation.</span></li>
<li data-index="1223"><span class="normal" data-index="1224">Companies should not defer inventory market declines beyond the interim period unless they are temporary and no loss is expected for the fiscal year.</span></li>
<li data-index="1225"><span class="normal" data-index="1226">Companies ordinarily should defer planned variances under a standard cost system; such variances are expected to be absorbed by year-end.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="1227">Companies often charge to the interim period, as incurred, costs and expenses other than product costs (often referred to as <b data-index="1228">period costs</b>). But companies may allocate these costs among interim periods on the basis of an estimate of time expired, benefit received, or activity associated with the periods. Companies display considerable latitude in accounting for these costs in interim periods, and many believe more definitive guidelines are needed.</p>
<p data-index="1229">Regarding disclosure, companies should report the following interim data at a minimum.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="1230">
<li data-index="1231"><span class="normal" data-index="1232">Sales or gross revenues, provision for income taxes, and net income.</span></li>
<li data-index="1233"><span class="normal" data-index="1234">Basic and diluted earnings per share where appropriate.</span></li>
<li data-index="1235"><span class="normal" data-index="1236">Seasonal revenue, cost, or expenses.</span></li>
<li data-index="1237"><span class="normal" data-index="1238">Significant changes in estimates or provisions for income taxes.</span></li>
<li data-index="1239"><span class="normal" data-index="1240">Disposal of a component of a business, and unusual or infrequently occurring items.</span></li>
<li data-index="1241"><span class="normal" data-index="1242">Contingent items.</span></li>
<li data-index="1243"><span class="normal" data-index="1244">Changes in accounting principles or estimates.</span></li>
<li data-index="1245"><span class="normal" data-index="1246">Significant changes in financial position.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="1247">The FASB encourages, but does not require, companies to publish an interim balance sheet and statement of cash flows. If a company does not present this information, it should disclose significant changes in such items as liquid assets, net working capital, long-term liabilities, and stockholders' equity.</p>
<h4 class="blue" data-index="1248"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-18" id="Page_24-18" data-index="1249"></span>Unique Problems of Interim Reporting</h4>
<p data-index="1250">Because of the short-term nature of the information in interim reports, there is considerable controversy as to the general approach companies should employ. One group, which favors the <span class="glossTerm" data-index="1251"><span class="blue" data-index="1252"><b data-index="1253">discrete approach</b></span></span>, believes that companies should treat each interim period as a separate accounting period. Using that treatment, companies would follow the principles for deferrals and accruals used for annual reports. In this view, companies should report accounting transactions as they occur, and expense recognition should not change with the period of time covered.</p>
<p data-index="1254">Another group, which favors the <span class="glossTerm" data-index="1255"><span class="blue" data-index="1256"><b data-index="1257">integral approach</b></span></span>, believes that the interim report is an integral part of the annual report and that deferrals and accruals should take into consideration what will happen for the entire year. In this approach, companies should assign estimated expenses to parts of a year on the basis of sales volume or some other activity base.</p>
<p data-index="1258">At present, many companies follow the discrete approach for certain types of expenses and the integral approach for others, given the standards currently employed in practice are vague and lead to differing interpretations.</p>
<p data-index="1259">Current GAAP reflects a preference for the integral approach. However, within this broad guideline, a number of unique reporting problems develop related to the following items.</p>
<h5 class="grey" data-index="1260">Advertising and Similar Costs</h5>
<p data-index="1261">The general guidelines are that companies should defer in an interim period costs such as advertising if the benefits extend beyond that period; otherwise, the company should expense those costs as incurred. But such a determination is difficult, and even if the company defers the costs, how should it allocate them between quarters?</p>
<p data-index="1262">Because of the vague guidelines in this area, accounting for advertising varies widely. At one time, some companies in the food industry, such as <span class="red" data-index="1263"><b data-index="1264">RJR Nabisco</b></span> and <span class="red" data-index="1265"><b data-index="1266">Pillsbury</b></span>, charged advertising costs as a percentage of sales and adjusted to actual at year-end, whereas <span class="red" data-index="1267"><b data-index="1268">General Foods</b></span> and <span class="red" data-index="1269"><b data-index="1270">Kellogg's</b></span> expensed these costs as incurred.</p>
<p data-index="1271">The same type of problem relates to such items as Social Security taxes, research and development costs, and major repairs. For example, should the company expense Social Security costs (payroll taxes) on highly paid personnel early in the year, or allocate and spread them to subsequent quarters? Should a major repair that occurs later in the year be anticipated and allocated proportionately to earlier periods?</p>
<h5 class="grey" data-index="1272">Expenses Subject to Year-End Adjustment</h5>
<p data-index="1273">Companies often do not know with a great deal of certainty amounts of bad debts, executive bonuses, pension costs, and inventory shrinkage until year-end. <b data-index="1274">They should estimate these costs and allocate them to in­terim periods as best they can.</b> Companies use a variety of allocation techniques to accomplish this objective.</p>
<h5 class="grey" data-index="1275">Income Taxes</h5>
<p data-index="1276"> Not every dollar of corporate taxable income is taxed at the same rate; the tax rate structure is progressive. This aspect of business income taxes poses a problem in preparing interim financial statements. Should the company use the <b data-index="1277">annualized approach</b>, which is to annualize income to date and accrue the proportionate income tax for the period to date? Or should it follow the <b data-index="1278">marginal principle approach</b>, which is to apply the lower rate of tax to the first amount of income earned? At one time, companies generally followed the latter approach and accrued the tax applicable to each additional dollar of income.</p>
<p data-index="1279">The profession now, however, uses the annualized approach. This requires that “at the end of each interim period the company should make its best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The rate so determined should be used in providing for income taxes on income for the quarter.” <b data-index="1280">[<a href="#c24-bib-0005" id="c24-bib-0005-1" data-index="1281" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-bib-0005" data-target-data-index="6604">5</a>]</b><a href="#c24-note-0008-a" id="c24-note-0008" data-index="1282" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0008-a" data-target-data-index="7165"><sup data-index="1283">8</sup></a></p>
<p data-index="1284"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-19" id="Page_24-19" data-index="1285"></span>Because businesses did not uniformly apply this guideline in accounting for similar situations, the FASB issued authoritative guidance. GAAP now requires companies, when computing the year-to-date tax, to apply the <b data-index="1286">estimated annual effective tax rate</b> to the year-to-date “ordinary” income at the end of each interim period. Further, the <b data-index="1287">interim period tax</b> related to “ordinary” income shall be the difference between the amount so computed and the amounts reported for previous interim periods of the fiscal period. <b data-index="1288">[<a href="#c24-bib-0006" id="c24-bib-0006-1" data-index="1289" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-bib-0006" data-target-data-index="6608">6</a>]</b><a href="#c24-note-0009-a" id="c24-note-0009" data-index="1290" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0009-a" data-target-data-index="7170"><sup data-index="1291">9</sup></a></p>
<h5 class="grey" data-index="1292">Earnings per Share</h5>
<p data-index="1293">Interim reporting of earnings per share has all the problems ­inherent in computing and presenting annual earnings per share, and then some. If a company issues shares in the third period, EPS for the first two periods will not reflect year-end EPS. For purposes of computing earnings per share and making the required disclosure determinations, each interim period should stand alone. That is, all applicable tests should be made for that single period.</p>
<h5 class="grey" data-index="1294">Seasonality</h5>
<p data-index="1295"><span class="glossTerm" data-index="1296"><span class="blue" data-index="1297"><b data-index="1298">Seasonality</b></span></span> occurs when most of a company's sales occur in one short period of the year while certain costs are fairly evenly spread throughout the year. For example, the natural gas industry has its heavy sales in the winter months. In contrast, the beverage industry has its heavy sales in the summer months.</p>
<p data-index="1299">The problem of seasonality is related to the expense recognition principle in accounting. Generally, expenses are associated with the revenues they create. In a seasonal business, wide fluctuations in profits occur because off-season sales do not absorb the company's fixed costs (for example, manufacturing, selling, and administrative costs that tend to remain fairly constant regardless of sales or production).</p>
<p data-index="1300">To illustrate why seasonality is a problem, assume the information shown in <a class="blue" href="#c24-fig-0009" id="c24-fig-0009-1" data-index="1301" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-fig-0009" data-target-data-index="1303"><b data-index="1302">Illustration 24.9</b></a>.</p>

<p data-index="1555">An investor who uses the first quarter's results might be misled. If the first quarter's earnings are $4,500, should this figure be multiplied by four to predict annual earnings of $18,000? Or, if first-quarter sales of $20,000 are 20 percent of the predicted sales for the year, would the net income for the year be $22,500 ($4,500 × 5)? Both figures are obviously wrong, and after the second quarter's results occur, the investor may become even more confused.</p>
<p data-index="1556">The problem with the conventional approach is that the fixed nonmanufacturing costs are not charged in proportion to sales. Some enterprises have adopted a way of avoiding this problem by making all fixed nonmanufacturing costs follow the sales pattern, as shown in <a class="blue" href="#c24-fig-0012" id="c24-fig-0012-1" data-index="1557" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-fig-0012" data-target-data-index="1559"><b data-index="1558">Illustration 24.12</b></a>.</p>

</figure>
<p data-index="1706">This approach solves some of the seasonality problems of interim reporting. Sales in the first quarter are 20 percent of total sales for the year, and net income in the first quarter is 20 percent of total income. In this case, as in the previous example, the investor cannot rely on multiplying any given quarter by four but can use comparative data or rely on some estimate of sales in relation to income for a given period.</p>
<p data-index="1707">The greater the degree of seasonality experienced by a company, the greater the possibility of distortion. Because there are no definitive guidelines for handling such items as the fixed nonmanufacturing costs, variability in income can be substantial. To alleviate this problem, the profession recommends that companies subject to material seasonal variations disclose the seasonal nature of their business and consider supplementing their interim reports with information for 12-month periods ended at the interim date for the current and preceding years.</p>
<p data-index="1708">The two illustrations highlight the difference between the <b data-index="1709">discrete</b> and <b data-index="1710">integral</b> approaches. <a href="#c24-fig-0011" data-index="1711" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-fig-0011" data-target-data-index="1395">Illustration 24.11</a> represents the discrete approach, in which the fixed nonmanufacturing ­expenses are expensed as incurred. <a href="#c24-fig-0012" data-index="1712" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-fig-0012" data-target-data-index="1559">Illustration 24.12</a> shows the integral approach, in which expenses are charged to expense on the basis of some measure of activity (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0010" data-index="1713" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0010" data-target-data-index="1719"><span class="green" data-index="1714"><b data-index="1715">Global View</b></span></a>).</p>

<h3 data-index="1729"><span class="codeColorPurple2" data-index="1730">Evolving Issue</span>  It's Faster but Is It Better?</h3>
<hr data-index="1731">
<p data-index="1732">The profession has developed some rules for interim reporting, but much still has to be done. As yet, it is unclear whether the discrete or the integral method, or some combination of the two, will be settled on.</p>
<p data-index="1733">Discussion also persists about the independent auditor's involvement in interim reports. Many auditors are reluctant to express an opinion on interim financial information, arguing that the data are too tentative and subjective. On the other hand, more people are advocating some examination of interim reports. As a compromise, the SEC currently requires that auditors perform a review of interim financial information. Such a review, which is much more limited in its procedures than the annual audit, provides some assurance that the interim information appears to be in accord with GAAP. [See AU-C Section 930, “Interim Financial Information,” <i data-index="1734">Statement on Auditing Standards No. 122</i>. Effective for audits of financial statements for periods ending on or after December 31, 2013. Predecessor literature: “Interim Financial Information,” <i data-index="1735">Statement on Auditing Standards No. 101</i> (New York: AICPA, 2002).]</p>
<p data-index="1736">The SEC also believes that timeliness of information is of extreme importance. First, the SEC has said that large public companies will have only 60 days to complete their annual reports, down from 90 days. Quarterly reports must be done within 40 days of the close of the quarter, instead of 45. In addition, corporate executives and shareholders with more than 10 percent of a company's outstanding stock now have  just two days to disclose their sale or purchase of stock.</p>
<p data-index="1737">In a bid to increase Internet disclosure, the SEC encourages companies to post current, quarterly, and annual reports on their <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-21" id="Page_24-21" data-index="1738"></span>websites—or explain why they don't. The Internet postings would have to be made by the day the company submits the information to the SEC, rather than within 24 hours as current rules allow. A steady stream of information from the company to the investor could be very positive because it might alleviate management's continual concern with short-run interim numbers.</p>
<p data-index="1739">As discussed, many contend that U.S. management is too oriented to the short-term, and some are calling for the SEC to eliminate all interim reporting requirements in response to the negative consequences of short-termism. For example, the Oracle of ­Omaha, Warren Buffett, has issued a call to move away from quarterly reporting. And President Trump tweeted that public companies should report their financial results only twice a year instead of quarterly, arguing it would reduce companies' costs of ­complying with bureaucratic red tape and help corporate executives focus on longer-term goals. The FASB is being judicious when establishing disclosures that are mandatory every reporting period and that the hurdle should be high for such requirements. The FASB is considering such advice in its ­Disclosure Framework project.</p>

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.</p>

<p data-index="1808">These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p data-index="1809">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.</p>
<p data-index="1810">Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>

</figure>
<p data-index="1830">In most cases, the auditor issues a standard <span class="glossTerm" data-index="1831"><span class="blue" data-index="1832"><b data-index="1833">unqualified (clean) opinion</b></span></span>. That is, the auditor expresses the opinion that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the entity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p data-index="1834">Certain circumstances, although they do not affect the auditor's unqualified opinion, may require the auditor to add an explanatory paragraph to the audit report. Some of the more important circumstances are as follows.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="1835">
<li data-index="1836"><span class="normal" data-index="1837"><b data-index="1838"><i data-index="1839">Going concern.</i></b> The auditor must evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's <b data-index="1840">ability to continue as a going concern</b> for a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration all available information about the future. (The future is at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period.) If substantial doubt exists about the company continuing as a going concern, the auditor adds to the report an explanatory note describing the potential problem.<a href="#c24-note-0011-a" id="c24-note-0011" data-index="1841" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0011-a" data-target-data-index="7181"><sup data-index="1842">11</sup></a></span></li>
<li data-index="1843"><span class="normal" data-index="1844"><b data-index="1845"><i data-index="1846">Lack of consistency.</i></b> If a company has changed accounting principles or the method of their application in a way that has a material effect on the comparability of its financial statements, the auditor should refer to the change in an explanatory paragraph of the report. Such an explanatory paragraph should identify the nature of the change and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-23" id="Page_24-23" data-index="1847"></span>refer readers to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change in detail. The auditor's concurrence with a change is implicit unless the auditor takes exception to the change in expressing an opinion as to fair presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</span></li>
<li data-index="1848"><span class="normal" data-index="1849"><b data-index="1850"><i data-index="1851">Emphasis of a matter.</i></b> The auditor may wish to emphasize a matter regarding the financial statements but nevertheless intends to express an unqualified opinion. For example, the auditor may wish to emphasize that the entity is a component of a larger business enterprise or that it has had significant transactions with related parties. The auditor presents such explanatory information in a separate paragraph of the report.<a href="#c24-note-0012-a" id="c24-note-0012" data-index="1852" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0012-a" data-target-data-index="7187"><sup data-index="1853">12</sup></a></span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="1854">In some situations, however, the auditor is required to express (1) a <b data-index="1855">qualified</b> opinion or (2) an <b data-index="1856">adverse</b> opinion, or (3) to <b data-index="1857">disclaim</b> an opinion.</p>
<p data-index="1858">A <span class="glossTerm" data-index="1859"><span class="blue" data-index="1860"><b data-index="1861">qualified opinion</b></span></span> contains an exception to the standard opinion. Ordinarily, the exception is not of sufficient magnitude to invalidate the statements as a whole; if it were, an adverse opinion would be rendered. The usual circumstances in which the auditor may deviate from the standard unqualified short-form report on financial statements are as follows.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="1862">
<li data-index="1863"><span class="normal" data-index="1864">The scope of the examination is limited or affected by conditions or restrictions.</span></li>
<li data-index="1865"><span class="normal" data-index="1866">The statements do not fairly present financial position or results of operations because of:</span>
<ol class="lower-latin" style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="1867">
<li data-index="1868"><span class="normal" data-index="1869">Lack of conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and standards.</span></li>
<li data-index="1870"><span class="normal" data-index="1871">Inadequate disclosure.</span></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="1872">If confronted with one of the situations noted above, the auditor must offer a qualified opinion. A qualified opinion states that, except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

In such a case, the financial statements taken as a whole are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adverse opinions are rare, because most companies change their accounting to conform with GAAP. The SEC will not permit a company listed on an exchange to have an adverse opinion.</p>

<p data-index="1910">The audit report should provide useful information to the investor. One investment banker noted, “Probably the first item to check is the auditor's opinion to see whether or not it is a clean one—‘in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles'—or is qualified in regard to differences between the auditor and company management in the accounting treatment of some major item, or in the outcome of some major litigation.”</p>

<hr data-index="1917">
<p data-index="1918">As we discussed in the opening story, financial disclosure is one of a number of institutional features that contribute to vibrant security markets. In fact, a recent study of disclosure and other mechanisms (such as civil lawsuits and criminal sanctions) found that good disclosure is the most important contributor to a vibrant market. The study, which compared disclosure and other legal and regulatory elements across 49 countries, found that countries with the best disclosure laws have the biggest stock markets.</p>
<p data-index="1919">Countries with more successful market environments also tend to have regulations that make it relatively easy for private investors to sue corporations that provide bad information. That is, while criminal sanctions can be effective in some circumstances, disclosure and other legal and regulatory elements encouraging good disclosure are the most important determinants of highly liquid and deep securities markets.</p>
<p data-index="1920">These findings hold for nations in all stages of economic development, with particular importance for nations that are in the early stages of securities regulation. In addition, countries with fewer market protections likely will benefit the most from adoption of international standards for market regulation and disclosure. The lesson: Disclosure is good for your market.</p>

<p data-index="2067"><span class="glossTerm" data-index="2068"><span class="blue" data-index="2069"><b data-index="2070">Fraudulent financial reporting</b></span></span> is defined as “intentional or reckless conduct, whether act or omission, that results in materially misleading financial statements.”<a href="#c24-note-0015-a" id="c24-note-0015" data-index="2071" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0015-a" data-target-data-index="7203"><sup data-index="2072">15</sup></a> Fraudulent reporting can involve gross and deliberate distortion of corporate records (such as inventory count tags), or misapplication of accounting principles (failure to disclose material transactions). Although frauds are unusual, recent events involving such well-known companies as <span class="red" data-index="2073"><b data-index="2074">Enron</b></span>, <span class="red" data-index="2075"><b data-index="2076">WorldCom</b></span>, <span class="red" data-index="2077"><b data-index="2078">Adelphia</b></span>, and <span class="red" data-index="2079"><b data-index="2080">Theranos</b></span> indicate that more must be done to address this issue.</p>
<h4 class="blue" data-index="2081">Causes of Fraudulent Financial Reporting</h4>
<p data-index="2082">Fraudulent financial reporting usually occurs because of conditions in a company's internal or external environment. Influences in the <b data-index="2083">internal environment</b> relate to poor internal control systems, management's poor attitude toward ethics, or perhaps a company's liquidity or profitability. Those in the <b data-index="2084">external environment</b> may relate to industry conditions, overall business environment, or legal and regulatory considerations.</p>
<p data-index="2085">General incentives for fraudulent financial reporting vary. Common ones are the desire to obtain a higher stock price, to avoid default on a loan covenant, or to make a personal gain of some type (additional compensation, promotion). Situational pressures on the company or an individual manager also may lead to fraudulent financial reporting. Examples of these situational pressures include the following.</p>
<ul data-index="2086">
<li data-index="2087"><span class="normal" data-index="2088"><b data-index="2089"><i data-index="2090">Sudden decreases in revenue or market share</i></b> for a single company or an entire ­industry.</span></li>
<li data-index="2091"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-27" id="Page_24-27" data-index="2092"></span><span class="normal" data-index="2093"><b data-index="2094"><i data-index="2095">Unrealistic budget pressures</i></b> may occur when headquarters arbitrarily determines profit objectives (particularly for short-term results) and budgets without taking actual conditions into account.</span></li>
<li data-index="2096"><span class="normal" data-index="2097"><b data-index="2098"><i data-index="2099">Financial pressure resulting from bonus plans</i></b> that depend on short-term economic performance. This pressure is particularly acute when the bonus is a significant component of the individual's total compensation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p data-index="2100">Opportunities for fraudulent financial reporting are present in circumstances when the fraud is easy to commit and when detection is difficult. Frequently, these opportunities arise from:</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="2101">
<li data-index="2102"><span class="normal" data-index="2103"><b data-index="2104"><i data-index="2105">The absence of a board of directors or audit committee</i></b> that vigilantly oversees the financial reporting process.</span></li>
<li data-index="2106"><span class="normal" data-index="2107"><b data-index="2108"><i data-index="2109">Weak or nonexistent internal accounting controls.</i></b> This situation can occur, for example, when a company's revenue system is overloaded as a result of a rapid expansion of sales, an acquisition of a new division, or the entry into a new, unfamiliar line of business.</span></li>
<li data-index="2110"><span class="normal" data-index="2111"><b data-index="2112"><i data-index="2113">Unusual or complex transactions</i></b> such as the consolidation of two companies, the ­divestiture or closing of a specific operation, and the purchase and sale of derivative ­instruments.</span></li>
<li data-index="2114"><span class="normal" data-index="2115"><b data-index="2116"><i data-index="2117">Accounting estimates requiring significant subjective judgment</i></b> by company management, such as the allowance for loan losses and the estimated liability for warranty expense.</span></li>
<li data-index="2118"><span class="normal" data-index="2119"><b data-index="2120"><i data-index="2121">Ineffective internal audit staffs</i></b> resulting from inadequate staff size and severely limited audit scope.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="2122">A weak corporate ethical climate contributes to these situations. Opportunities for fraudulent financial reporting also increase dramatically when the accounting principles followed in reporting transactions are nonexistent, evolving, or subject to varying interpretations.<a href="#c24-note-0016-a" id="c24-note-0016" data-index="2123" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0016-a" data-target-data-index="7207"><sup data-index="2124">16</sup></a></p>

The same treatment should be given to fraud. The discovery of fraud, however, gives rise to a different set of procedures and responsibilities for the accountant/auditor.<a href="#c24-note-0018-a" id="c24-note-0018" data-index="2162" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0018-a" data-target-data-index="7218"><sup data-index="2163">18</sup></a> <span class="glossTerm" data-index="2164"><span class="blue" data-index="2165"><b data-index="2166">Illegal acts</b></span></span> encompass such items as illegal political contributions, bribes, kickbacks, and other violations of laws and regulations.<a href="#c24-note-0019-a" id="c24-note-0019" data-index="2167" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0019-a" data-target-data-index="7222"><sup data-index="2168">19</sup></a> In these situations, the accountant/auditor must evaluate the adequacy of disclosure in the financial statements. For example, if a company derives revenue from an illegal act that is considered material in relation to the financial statements, this information should be disclosed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to deter these illegal acts. This law adds significant fines and longer jail time for those who improperly sign off on the correctness of financial statements that include willing and knowing misstatements.</p>
<p data-index="2169">Disclosure plays a very important role in these types of transactions because the events are more qualitative than quantitative and involve more subjective than objective evaluation. Users of the financial statements need some indication of the existence and nature of these transactions, through disclosures, modifications in the auditor's report (as discussed above), or reports of changes in auditors.</p>
<h4 class="blue" data-index="2170">Response by the Profession</h4>
<p data-index="2171">The AICPA has issued numerous auditing standards in response to concerns of the accounting profession, the media, and the public.<a href="#c24-note-0020-a" id="c24-note-0020" data-index="2172" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0020-a" data-target-data-index="7228"><sup data-index="2173">20</sup></a> For example, the standard on fraudulent financial <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-29" id="Page_24-29" data-index="2174"></span>reporting “raises the bar” on the performance of financial statement audits by ex­plicitly requiring auditors to assess the risk of material financial misstatement due to fraud.<a href="#c24-note-0021-a" id="c24-note-0021" data-index="2175" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0021-a" data-target-data-index="7233"><sup data-index="2176">21</sup></a> As indicated earlier, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act now raises the penalty substantially for executives who are involved in fraudulent financial reporting.</p>

<h3 data-index="2178"><span class="red" data-index="2179">Internet Financial Reporting</span></h3>
<p data-index="2180">Most companies now use the power and reach of the Internet to provide more useful information to financial statement readers. All large companies have Internet sites, and a large proportion of companies' websites contain links to their financial statements and other disclosures. The popularity of such reporting is not surprising since it reduces the companies' costs of printing and disseminating paper reports.</p>
<p data-index="2181">Does Internet financial reporting improve the usefulness of a company's financial reports? Yes, in several ways. First, dissemination of reports via the Web allows firms <b data-index="2182">to communicate more easily and quickly with users</b> than do traditional paper reports. In addition, <b data-index="2183">Internet reporting allows users to take advantage of tools</b> such as search engines and hyperlinks to quickly find information about the firm and to download the information for analysis. Finally, <b data-index="2184">Internet reporting can help make financial reports more relevant</b> by allowing companies to report expanded disaggregated data and more timely data than is possible through paper-based reporting. For example, some companies voluntarily report weekly sales data and segment operating data on their websites.</p>
<p data-index="2185">Given the widespread use of the Internet by investors and creditors, it is not surprising that organizations are developing new technologies and standards to further enable and enhance Internet financial reporting. An example is the established use of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). <span class="glossTerm" data-index="2186"><span class="blue" data-index="2187"><b data-index="2188">XBRL</b></span></span> is a computer language adapted from the code of the Internet. It “tags” accounting data to correspond to financial reporting items that are reported in the balance sheet, income statement, and the cash flow statement. Once tagged, any company's XBRL data can be easily processed using spreadsheets and other computer programs. In fact, the SEC is phasing in requirements for all companies and mutual funds to prepare their financial reports using XBRL, thereby allowing users to more easily search a company's reports, extract and analyze data, and perform financial comparisons within industries.<a href="#c24-note-0022-a" id="c24-note-0022" data-index="2189" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0022-a" data-target-data-index="7239"><sup data-index="2190">22</sup></a></p>
<p data-index="2191">To complement the implementation of XBRL use, the SEC has supplemented its EDGAR database with a system called IDEA (short for Interactive Data Electronic Applications). This enhancement of EDGAR marks the SEC's transition from collecting forms and documents to making the information itself freely available to investors in a timely form they can readily use. With IDEA, investors are able to quickly collate information from thousands of companies and forms and create reports and analyses on the fly, in any way they choose. IDEA has opened the door for both the SEC and investors to the new world of financial disclosure in interactive data (XBRL) format.<a href="#c24-note-0023-a" id="c24-note-0023" data-index="2192" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0023-a" data-target-data-index="7246"><sup data-index="2193">23</sup></a></p>

</ul>
<p data-index="2222">The difference between a financial forecast and a financial projection is clear-cut.

<hr data-index="2288">
<p data-index="2289">Great Britain permits financial forecasts, and the results have been fairly successful. Some significant differences do exist between the English and the U.S. business and legal environments. The British system, for example, does not permit litigation on forecasted information, and the solicitor (lawyer) is not permitted to work on a contingent-fee basis.</p>
<p data-index="2290">But such differences probably could be overcome if ­influential interests in this country cooperated to produce an atmosphere conducive to quality forecasting. A typical British forecast adapted from a construction company's report to support a public offering of stock is as follows.</p>
<blockquote style=" background-color: #F0FFFF;" data-index="2291">
<p data-index="2292">Profits have grown substantially over the past 10 years and directors are confident of being able to continue this expansion… . While the rate of expansion will be dependent on the level of economic activity in Ireland and England, the group is well structured to avail itself of opportunities as they arise, particularly in the field of property development, which is expected to play an increasingly important role in the group's future expansion.</p>
<p data-index="2293">Profits before taxation for the half year ended 30th June were 402,000 pounds. On the basis of trading experiences since that date and the present level of sales and completions, the directors expect that in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the group's profits before taxation for the year to 31st December will be not less than 960,000 pounds.</p>
<p data-index="2294">No dividends will be paid in respect of the current year. In a full financial year, on the basis of above forecasts (not including full year profits) it would be the intention of the board, assuming current rates of tax, to recommend dividends totaling 40% (of after-tax profits), which will be payable in the next two years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-index="2295">A general narrative-type forecast issued by a U.S. corporation might appear as follows.</p>
<blockquote style=" background-color: #F0FFFF;" data-index="2296">
<p data-index="2297">On the basis of promotions planned by the company for the second half of the fiscal year, net earnings for that period are expected to be approximately the same as those for the first half of the fiscal year, with net earnings for the third quarter expected to make the predominant contribution to net earnings for the second half of the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-index="2298">As indicated, the U.S. version is much less specific in its forecasted information.</p>
<p class="source" data-index="2299"><b data-index="2300">Source:</b> See “A Case for Forecasting—The British Have Tried It and Find That It Works,” <i data-index="2301">World</i> (New York: Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., Autumn 1978), pp. 10–13. In a recent survey, U.K. companies remain stubbornly backward-looking. Just 5 percent of FTSE 100 companies address the future of the business in their discussion and analysis.

<h4 class="blue" data-index="2304">Questions of Liability</h4>
<p data-index="2305">What happens if a company does not meet its forecasts? Can the company and the auditor be sued? If a company, for example, projects an earnings increase of 15 percent and achieves only 5 percent, should stockholders be permitted to have some judicial recourse against the company?</p>
<p data-index="2306">One court case involving <span class="red" data-index="2307"><b data-index="2308">Monsanto Chemical Corporation</b></span> set a precedent. In this case, Monsanto predicted that sales would increase 8 to 9 percent and that earnings would rise 4 to 5 percent. In the last part of the year, the demand for Monsanto's products dropped as a result of a business turndown. Instead of increasing, the company's earnings declined. Investors sued the company because the projected earnings figure was erroneous, but a judge dismissed the suit because the forecasts were the best estimates of qualified people whose intents were honest.</p>
<p data-index="2309">As indicated earlier, the SEC's safe harbor rules are intended to protect companies that provide good-faith projections. However, much concern exists as to how the SEC and the courts will interpret such terms as “good faith” and “reasonable assumptions” when erroneous forecasts mislead users of this information.</p>

<h3 data-index="2311"><span class="red" data-index="2312">Criteria for Making Accounting and Reporting&nbsp;Choices</span></h3>
<p data-index="2313">Throughout this text, we have stressed the need to provide information that is useful to predict the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. To achieve this objective, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-32" id="Page_24-32" data-index="2314"></span>companies must make judicious choices between alternative accounting concepts, methods, and means of disclosure. You are probably surprised by the large number of choices that exist among acceptable alternatives.</p>
<p data-index="2315">You should recognize, however, as indicated in <a href="c01.xhtml" data-index="2316" data-section-index="11">Chapter 1</a>, that accounting is greatly influenced by its environment. It does not exist in a vacuum. Therefore, it is unrealistic to assume that the profession can entirely eliminate alternative presentations of certain transactions and events. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that the profession, by adhering to the conceptual framework, will be able to focus on the needs of financial statement users and eliminate diversity where appropriate. The SEC's and FASB's projects on principles-based standards and disclosure effectiveness are directed at these very issues. They seek to develop guidance that will result in accounting and financial reporting that reflects the economic substance of the transactions, not the desired financial result of management. The profession must continue its efforts to develop a sound foundation upon which to build financial standards and practice (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0014" data-index="2317" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0014" data-target-data-index="2323"><span class="red" data-index="2318"><b data-index="2319">Underlying Concepts</b></span></a>).

</aside>
<p data-index="2344">What would be important to you in studying a company's financial statements? The answer depends on your particular interest—whether you are a creditor, stockholder, potential investor, manager, government agency, or labor leader. For example, <b data-index="2345">short-term creditors</b> such as banks are primarily interested in the ability of the firm to pay its currently maturing obligations. In that case, you would examine the current assets and their relation to short-term liabilities to evaluate the short-run solvency of the firm.</p>
<p data-index="2346"><b data-index="2347">Bondholders</b>, on the other hand, look more to long-term indicators, such as the enterprise's capital structure, past and projected earnings, and changes in financial position. <b data-index="2348">Stockholders</b>, present or prospective, also are interested in many of the features considered by a long-term creditor. As a stockholder, you would focus on the earnings picture, because changes in it greatly affect the market price of your investment. You also would be concerned with the financial position of the company, because it affects indirectly the stability of earnings.</p>
<p data-index="2349">The <b data-index="2350">managers</b> of a company are concerned about the composition of its capital structure and about the changes and trends in earnings. This financial information has a direct influence on the type, amount, and cost of external financing that the company can obtain. In addition, the company managers find financial information useful on a day-to-day operating basis in such areas as capital budgeting, break-even analysis, variance analysis, gross margin analysis, and for internal control purposes.</p>

<h2 data-index="2354"><span class="codeColorBlue2" data-index="2355">Perspective on Financial Statement&nbsp;Analysis</span></h2>
<p data-index="2356">Readers of financial statements can gather information by examining relationships between items on the statements and identifying trends in these relationships. The relationships are expressed numerically in ratios and percentages, and trends are identified through comparative analysis (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0016" data-index="2357" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0016" data-target-data-index="2363"><span class="red" data-index="2358"><b data-index="2359">Underlying Concepts</b></span></a>).</p>

<p data-index="2366">Because financial ­statements report on the past, they emphasize the ­<i data-index="2367">qualitative ­characteristic of feedback value</i>. This feedback value is useful because it can be used to better achieve the ­<i data-index="2368">qualitative characteristic of ­predictive value</i>.</p>
</section>
<div class="bottom hr" data-index="2369"><hr data-index="2370"></div>
</aside>
<p data-index="2371">A problem with learning how to analyze statements is that the means may become an end in itself. Analysts could identify and calculate thousands of possible relationships and trends. If one knows only how to calculate ratios and trends without understanding <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-33" id="Page_24-33" data-index="2372"></span>how such information can be used, little is accomplished. Therefore, a logical approach to financial statement analysis is necessary, consisting of the following steps.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="2373">
<li data-index="2374"><span class="normal" data-index="2375"><b data-index="2376"><i data-index="2377">Know the questions for which you want to find answers.</i></b> As indicated earlier, various groups have different types of interest in a company.</span></li>
<li data-index="2378"><span class="normal" data-index="2379"><b data-index="2380"><i data-index="2381">Know the questions that particular ratios and comparisons are able to help answer</i></b>. These will be discussed in this appendix.</span></li>
<li data-index="2382"><span class="normal" data-index="2383"><b data-index="2384"><i data-index="2385">Match 1 and 2 above.</i></b> By such a matching, the statement analysis will have a logical direction and purpose.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="2386">Several caveats must be mentioned. <b data-index="2387">Financial statements report on the past.</b> Thus, analysis of these data is an examination of the past. When using such information in a decision-making (future-oriented) process, analysts assume that the past is a reasonable basis for predicting the future. This is usually a reasonable approach, but its limitations should be recognized.</p>
<p data-index="2388">Also, ratio and trend analyses will help identify a company's present strengths and weaknesses. They may serve as “red flags” indicating problem areas. In many cases, however, such analyses will not reveal <b data-index="2389">why</b> things are as they are. Finding answers about “why” usually requires an in-depth analysis and an awareness of many factors about a company that are not reported in the financial statements.</p>
<p data-index="2390">Another caveat is that a <b data-index="2391">single ratio by itself is not likely to be very useful</b>. For example, analysts may generally view a current ratio of 2 to 1 (current assets are twice current liabilities) as satisfactory. However, if the industry average is 3 to 1, such a conclusion may be invalid. Even given this industry average, one may conclude that the particular company is doing well if one knows the previous year's ratio was 1.5 to 1. Consequently, to derive meaning from ratios, analysts need some standard against which to compare them. Such a standard may come from industry averages, past years' amounts, a particular competitor, or planned levels.</p>
<p data-index="2392">Finally, <b data-index="2393">awareness of the limitations of accounting numbers used in an analysis</b> is important (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0017" data-index="2394" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0017" data-target-data-index="2400"><span class="green" data-index="2395"><b data-index="2396">Global View</b></span></a>). We will discuss some of these limitations and their consequences later in this appendix.</p>

<p data-index="2403">Some companies outside the United States provide “convenience” financial statements for U.S. readers. These financial statements have been translated into English, and they may also translate the currency units into U.S. dollars. However, the statements are <i data-index="2404">not restated</i> using U.S. accounting principles; financial statement analysis needs to take this fact into account.</p>

</aside>
<p data-index="2749">The reader of financial statements must understand the basic limitations associated with ratio analysis. As analytical tools, ratios are attractive because they are simple and convenient. But too frequently, decision-makers base their decisions on only these simple computations. The ratios are only as good as the data upon which they are based and the information with which they are compared.</p>
<p data-index="2750">One important limitation of ratios is that they generally are <b data-index="2751">based on historical cost</b>, <b data-index="2752">which can lead to distortions in measuring performance</b>. Inaccurate assessments of the enterprise's financial condition and performance can result from failing to incorporate fair value information.</p>
<p data-index="2753">Also, investors must remember that <b data-index="2754">where estimated items (such as depreciation and amortization) are significant</b>, <b data-index="2755">income ratios lose some of their credibility</b>. For example, income recognized before the termination of a company's life is an approximation. In analyzing the income statement, users should be aware of the uncertainty surrounding the computation of net income.</p>
<p data-index="2756">As one writer aptly noted, “The physicist has long since conceded that the location of an electron is best expressed by a probability curve. Surely an abstraction like earnings per share is even more subject to the rules of probability and risk.”<a href="#c24-note-0030-a" id="c24-note-0030" data-index="2757" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0030-a" data-target-data-index="7286"><sup data-index="2758">30</sup></a></p>
<p data-index="2759">Probably the greatest limitation of ratio analysis is the <b data-index="2760">difficult problem of achieving comparability among firms in a given industry</b>. Achieving comparability requires that the analyst (1) identify basic differences in companies' accounting principles and procedures, and (2) adjust the balances to achieve comparability (see <a href="#c24-feafxd-0020" data-index="2761" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-feafxd-0020" data-target-data-index="2767"><span class="red" data-index="2762"><b data-index="2763">Underlying Concepts</b></span></a>). Basic differences in accounting usually involve one of the following areas.</p>
<aside class="feature3 tbc" data-index="2764">

<h4 data-index="2768"><span class="red" data-index="2769">Underlying Concepts</span></h4>
<p data-index="2770">Consistency and comparability are important concepts for financial statement analysis. If the principles and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements are continually changing, accurate assessments of a company's progress become difficult.</p>

<li data-index="2774"><span class="normal" data-index="2775">Inventory valuation (FIFO, LIFO, average-cost).</span></li>
<li data-index="2776"><span class="normal" data-index="2777">Depreciation methods, particularly the use of straight-line versus accelerated depreciation.</span></li>
<li data-index="2778"><span class="normal" data-index="2779">Capitalization versus expensing of certain costs.</span></li>
<li data-index="2780"><span class="normal" data-index="2781">Investments in common stock carried at equity versus fair value.</span></li>

<li data-index="2784"><span class="normal" data-index="2785">Questionable practices of defining discontinued operations and impairments.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="2786">The use of these different alternatives can make a significant difference in the ratios computed. For example, at one time <span class="red" data-index="2787"><b data-index="2788">Anheuser-Busch InBev</b></span> noted that if it had used average-cost for inventory valuation instead of LIFO, inventories would have increased approximately $33,000,000. Such an increase would have a substantive impact on the current ratio. Several studies have analyzed the impact of different accounting methods on financial statement analysis. The differences in income that can develop are staggering in some cases. Investors must be aware of the potential pitfalls if they are to be able to make the proper adjustments.</p>
<p data-index="2789">Finally, analysts should recognize that a <b data-index="2790">substantial amount of important information</b> is not included in a company's financial statements. Events involving such things as industry changes, management changes, competitors' actions, technological developments, government actions, and union activities are often critical to a company's successful operation. These events occur continuously, and information about them must come from careful analysis of financial reports in the media and other sources. Indeed many argue, in what is known as the ­<b data-index="2791">efficient-market hypothesis</b>, that financial statements contain “no surprises” to those engaged in market activities. They contend that the effect of these events is known in the marketplace—and the price of the company's stock adjusts accordingly—well before the issuance of such reports.</p>

Ratio analysis provides only a single snapshot, for one given point or period in time. In a comparative analysis, an investment analyst can concentrate on a given item and determine whether it appears to be growing or diminishing year by year and the proportion of such change to related items. Generally, companies present comparative financial statements. They typically include two years of balance sheet information and three years of income statement information.</p>
<p data-index="2811">In addition, many companies include in their annual reports five- or ten-year summaries of pertinent data that permit readers to examine and analyze trends. As indicated in GAAP, “the presentation of comparative financial statements in annual and other reports enhances the usefulness of such reports and brings out more clearly the nature and trends of current changes affecting the enterprise.” <a class="blue" href="#c24-fig-0020" id="c24-fig-0020-1" data-index="2812" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-fig-0020" data-target-data-index="2814"><b data-index="2813">Illustration 24A.2</b></a> presents a five-year condensed statement, with additional supporting data, of Anetek Chemical Corporation.</p>

For example, analysts frequently express all items in an income statement as a percentage of sales or sometimes as a percentage of cost of goods sold. They may analyze a balance sheet on the basis of total assets. Percentage analysis facilitates comparison and is helpful in evaluating the relative size of items or the relative change in items. A conversion of absolute dollar amounts to percentages may also facilitate comparison between companies of different size.</p>

<p data-index="3328">This approach, normally called <span class="glossTerm" data-index="3329"><span class="blue" data-index="3330"><b data-index="3331">horizontal analysis</b></span></span>, indicates the proportionate change over a period of time.

</figure>
<p data-index="3445">Vertical analysis is frequently called <span class="glossTerm" data-index="3446"><span class="blue" data-index="3447"><b data-index="3448">common-size analysis</b></span></span> because it reduces all of the statement items to a “common size.” That is, all of the elements within each statement are expressed in percentages of some common number and always add up to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-38" id="Page_24-38" data-index="3449"></span>100 percent. Common-size (percentage) analysis reveals the composition of each of the financial statements.</p>
<p data-index="3450">In the analysis of the balance sheet, common-size analysis answers such questions as: What percentage of the capital structure is stockholders' equity, current liabilities, and long-term debt? What is the mix of assets (percentage-wise) with which the company has chosen to conduct business? What percentage of current assets is in inventory, receivables, and so forth?</p>
<p data-index="3451">Common-size analysis of the income statement typically relates each item to sales. It is instructive to know what proportion of each sales dollar is absorbed by various costs and expenses incurred by the enterprise.</p>
<p data-index="3452">Analysts may use common-size statements to compare one company's statements from different years in order to detect trends not evident from comparing absolute amounts. Also, common-size statements provide intercompany comparisons regardless of size because they recast financial statements into a comparable common-size format.</p>

<p data-index="3585">The <b data-index="3586">full disclosure principle</b> calls for financial reporting of any financial facts significant enough to influence the judgment of an informed reader. Implementing the full disclosure principle is difficult because the cost of disclosure can be substantial and the benefits difficult to assess. Disclosure requirements have increased because of (1) the growing complexity of the business environment, (2) the necessity for timely information, and (3) the use of accounting as a control and monitoring device.</p>
<p data-index="3587"><b data-index="3588">Notes in financial statement preparation.</b> Notes are the accountant's means of amplifying or explaining the items presented in the main body of the statements. Notes can explain in qualitative terms information pertinent to specific financial statement items, and can provide supplementary data of a quantitative nature. Common note disclosures relate to such items as accounting policies; inventories; property, plant, and equipment; creditor claims; contingencies and commitments; and subsequent events.</p>

<p data-index="3600">In <b data-index="3601">related-party transactions,</b> one party has the ability to significantly influence the policies of the other. As a result, GAAP requires <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-39" id="Page_24-39" data-index="3602"></span>disclosure of the relationship(s) involved, a description and dollar amounts of the transactions, and amounts due from or to related parties. For <b data-index="3603">post-balance-sheet events</b>, companies should disclose recognized subsequent events as well as nonrecognized subsequent events. Finally, aggregated figures hide much information about the composition of these consolidated figures. There is no way to tell from the consolidated data the extent to which the differing product lines contribute to the company's profitability, risk, and growth potential. As a result, the profession requires <b data-index="3604">segment information</b> in certain situations.</p>
<p data-index="3605"><b data-index="3606">Interim reports</b> cover periods of less than one year. Two viewpoints exist regarding interim reports. The discrete approach holds that each interim period should be treated as a separate accounting period. The integral approach is that the interim report is an integral part of the annual report and that deferrals and accruals should take into consideration what will happen for the entire year.</p>
<p data-index="3607">Companies should use the same accounting principles for interim reports that they use for annual reports. A number of unique reporting problems develop related to the following items: (1) advertising and similar costs, (2) expenses subject to year-end adjustment, (3) income taxes, (4) earnings per share, and (5) seasonality.</p>

<p data-index="3621">An adverse opinion is required when the exceptions to fair presentation are so material that a qualified opinion is not justified.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has numerous provisions intended to help prevent fraudulent financial reporting.</p>
<p data-index="3637"><b data-index="3638">Financial forecasts.</b> The SEC has indicated that companies are permitted (not required) to include profit forecasts in their reports.

<p data-index="3650">Basic financial statement analysis involves examining relationships between items on the statements (ratio and percentage analysis) and identifying trends in these relationships (comparative analysis). Analysis is used to predict the future, but ratio analysis is limited because the data are from the past. Also, ratio analysis identifies present strengths and weaknesses of a company, but it may not reveal <i data-index="3651">why</i> they exist. Although single ratios are helpful, they are not conclusive. For maximum usefulness, analysts must compare them with industry averages, past years, planned amounts, and the like.</p>

<p data-index="3703">Percentage analysis consists of reducing a series of related amounts to a series of percentages of a given base. Analysts use two approaches. <i data-index="3704">Horizontal analysis</i> indicates the proportionate change in financial statement items over a period of time; such analysis is most helpful in evaluating trends. <i data-index="3705">Vertical analysis</i> (common-size analysis) is a proportional expression of each item on the financial statements in a given period to a base amount. It analyzes the composition of each of the financial statements from different years (a) to detect trends not evident from the comparison of absolute amounts and (b) to make intercompany comparisons of different-sized enterprises.</p>

<p class="normal" data-index="3876">Sales revenue and cost of goods sold receive the same treatment as if this were an annual report. Costs and expenses other than product costs should be charged to expense in interim periods as incurred or allocated among interim periods. Consequently, the variable selling expenses and the portion of fixed selling expenses not related to Internet advertising should be reported in full. One-fourth of the Internet advertising is reported as an expense in the first quarter, assuming the advertising is constant throughout the year. These costs can be deferred within the fiscal period if the benefits of the expenditure clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the expenditure is made.</p></li>

Daniel Brown, who owns 15% of the common stock, was one of the organizers of Bradburn and is its current president. The company has been successful, but it currently is experiencing a shortage of funds. On June 10, 2021, Daniel Brown approached the Topeka National Bank, asking for a 24-month extension on two $35,000 notes, which are due on June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021. Another note of $6,000 is due on March 31, 2022, but he expects no difficulty in paying this note on its due date. Brown explained that Bradburn's cash flow problems are due primarily to the company's desire to finance a $300,000 plant expansion over the next 2 fiscal years through internally generated funds.</p>

In connection with her examination of Ace's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, Gloria Rodd, CPA, completed field work 2 weeks ago. Ms. Rodd now is evaluating the significance of the following items prior to preparing her auditor's report. Except as noted, none of these items have been disclosed in the financial statements or notes.</p>
<p data-index="5514"><b data-index="5515">Item 1:</b> A 10-year loan agreement, which the company entered into 3 years ago, provides that dividend payments may not exceed net income earned after taxes subsequent to the date of the agreement. The balance of retained earnings at the date of the loan agreement was $420,000. From that date through December 31, 2021, net income after taxes has totaled $570,000 and cash dividends have totaled $320,000. On the basis of these data, the staff auditor assigned to this review concluded that there was no retained earnings restriction at December 31, 2021.</p>
<p data-index="5516"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-51" id="Page_24-51" data-index="5517"></span><b data-index="5518">Item 2:</b> Recently Ace interrupted its policy of paying cash dividends quarterly to its stockholders. Dividends were paid regularly through 2020, discontinued for all of 2021 to finance purchase of equipment for the company's new plant, and resumed in the first quarter of 2022. In the annual report, dividend policy is to be discussed in the president's letter to stockholders.</p>
<p data-index="5519"><b data-index="5520">Item 3:</b> A major electronics firm has introduced a line of products that will compete directly with Ace's primary line, now being produced in the specially designed new plant. Because of manufacturing innovations, the competitor's line will be of comparable quality but priced 50% below Ace's line. The competitor announced its new line during the week following completion of field work. Ms. Rodd read the announcement in the newspaper and discussed the situation by telephone with Ace executives. Ace will meet the lower prices that are high enough to cover variable manufacturing and selling expenses but will permit recovery of only a portion of fixed costs.</p>
<p data-index="5521"><b data-index="5522">Item 4:</b> The company's new manufacturing plant building, which cost $2,400,000 and has an estimated life of 25 years, is leased from Wichita National Bank at an annual rental of $600,000. The company is obligated to pay property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. At the conclusion of its 10-year noncancelable lease, the company has the option of purchasing the property for $1. In Ace's income statement, the rental payment is reported on a separate line.</p>

<p data-index="5536"><b data-index="5537">Situation 2:</b> Subsequent to the date of a set of financial statements but prior to the issuance of the financial statements, a company enters into a contract that will probably result in a significant loss to the company. The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.</p>
<p data-index="5538"><b data-index="5539">Situation 3:</b> A company has adopted a policy of recording self-insurance for any possible losses resulting from injury to others by the company's vehicles. The premium for an insurance policy for the same risk from an independent insurance company would have an annual cost of $4,000. During the period covered by the financial statements, there were no accidents involving the company's vehicles that resulted in injury to others.</p>

Net sales for the year 2020 were $18,000,000, and net income was $800,000. As auditors of this company, you are making a review of subsequent events on February 13, 2021, and you find the following.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="5552">
<li data-index="5553"><span class="normal" data-index="5554">On February 3, 2021, one of Coburn's customers declared bankruptcy. At December 31, 2020, this company owed Coburn $300,000, of which $60,000 was paid in January 2021.</span></li>
<li data-index="5555"><span class="normal" data-index="5556">On January 18, 2021, one of the three major plants of the client burned.</span></li>
<li data-index="5557"><span class="normal" data-index="5558">On January 23, 2021, a strike was called at one of Coburn's largest plants, which halted 30% of its production. As of today (February 13), the strike has not been settled.</span></li>

<li data-index="5561"><span class="normal" data-index="5562">Merchandise traded in the open market is recorded in the company's records at $1.40 per unit on ­December 31, 2020.

The price throughout the preceding year had been about $2, which was the level experienced over several years. On January 18, 2021, the price returned to $2, after public disclosure of an error in the official calculations of the prior December, correction of which destroyed the expectations of excessive supplies. Inventory at December 31, 2020, was on a lower-of-LIFO-cost-or-market basis.</span></li>

<p data-index="6110">Okay. Last fall, someone with a long memory and an even longer arm reached into that bureau drawer and came out with a moldy cheese sandwich and the equally moldy notion of corporate forecasts. We tried to find out what happened to the cheese sandwich—but, rats!, even recourse to the Freedom of Information Act didn't help. However, the forecast proposal was dusted off, polished up and found quite serviceable. The SEC, indeed, lost no time in running it up the old flagpole—but no one was very eager to salute. Even after some of the more objectionable features—compulsory corrections and detailed explanations of why the estimates went awry—were peeled off the original proposal.</p>
<p data-index="6111">Seemingly, despite the Commission's smiles and sweet talk, those craven corporations were still afraid that an honest mistake would lead them down the primrose path to consent decrees and class action suits. To lay to rest such qualms, the Commission last week approved a “Safe Harbor” rule that, providing the forecasts were made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, protected corporations from litigation should the projections prove wide of the mark (as only about 99% are apt to do).</p>

The controller, not sure of her supervisor's motives, hesitates to suggest to Tercek that the company's improvement is unrelated to efficiency in controlling cost. To complicate matters, the media release is scheduled in a few days.</p>

Jennifer Grayson, treasurer for McElroy Enterprises Inc., is concerned about the date when the bonds are issued. The company really needs the cash, but she is worried that if the bonds are issued before the company's year-end (December 31, 2020) the additional liability will have an adverse effect on a number of important ratios. In July, she explains to company president William McElroy that if they delay issuing the bonds until after December 31 the bonds will not affect the ratios until December 31, 2021. They will have to report the issuance as a subsequent event which requires only footnote disclosure. Grayson expects that with expected improved financial performance in 2021, ratios should be better.</p>

<p data-index="6673">IFRS and GAAP disclosure requirements are similar in many regards. The IFRS addressing various disclosure issues are <i data-index="6674">IAS 24</i> (“Related Party Disclosures”), disclosure and recognition of post-statement of financial position events in <i data-index="6675">IAS 10</i> (“Events after the Balance Sheet Date”), segment reporting IFRS provisions in <i data-index="6676">IFRS 8</i> (“Operating Segments”), and interim reporting requirements in <i data-index="6677">IAS 34</i> (“Interim Financial Reporting”).</p>
<h4 data-index="6678"><span class="blue" data-index="6679">Relevant Facts</span></h4>
<p data-index="6680">Following are the key similarities and differences between GAAP and IFRS related to disclosures.</p>
<h5 data-index="6681"><span class="red" data-index="6682">Similarities</span></h5>
<ul data-index="6683">
<li data-index="6684">GAAP and IFRS have similar standards on post-statement of financial position (subsequent) events. That is, under both sets of standards, events that occurred after the statement of financial position date, and which provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the statement of financial position date, are recognized in the financial statements.</li>
<li data-index="6685">Like GAAP, IFRS requires that for transactions with related parties, companies disclose the amounts involved in a transaction; the amount, terms, and nature of the outstanding balances; and any doubtful amounts related to those outstanding balances for each major category of related parties.</li>
<li data-index="6686">Following the issuance of IFRS 8, “Operating Segments,” the requirements under IFRS and GAAP are very similar. That is, both standards use the management approach to identify reportable segments, and similar segment disclosures are required.</li>
<li data-index="6687">Neither GAAP nor IFRS require interim reports. Rather, the SEC and securities exchanges outside the United States establish the rules. In the United States, interim reports generally are provided on a quarterly basis; outside the United States, six-month interim reports are common.</li>
</ul>
<h5 data-index="6688"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-60" id="Page_24-60" data-index="6689"></span><span class="red" data-index="6690">Differences</span></h5>
<ul data-index="6691">
<li data-index="6692">Due to the broader range of judgments allowed in more principles-based IFRS, note disclosures generally are more expansive under IFRS compared to GAAP.</li>
<li data-index="6693">Subsequent (or post-statement of financial position) events under IFRS are evaluated through the date that financial instruments are “authorized for issue.” GAAP uses the date when financial statements are “issued.” Also, for share dividends and splits in the subsequent period, IFRS does not adjust but GAAP does.</li>
<li data-index="6694">Under IFRS, there is no specific requirement to disclose the name of the related party, which is the case under GAAP.</li>
<li data-index="6695">Under IFRS, interim reports are prepared on a discrete basis; GAAP generally follows the integral approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4 data-index="6696"><span class="blue" data-index="6697">About the Numbers</span></h4>
<br data-index="6698">
<h5 data-index="6699"><span class="red" data-index="6700">Differential Disclosure</span></h5>
<p data-index="6701">A trend toward differential disclosure is occurring. The IASB has developed IFRS for small- and medium-sized entities (SMEs). SMEs are entities that publish general-purpose financial statements for external users but do not issue shares or other securities in a public market. Many believe a simplified set of standards makes sense for these companies because they do not have the resources to implement full IFRS. Simplified IFRS for SMEs is a single standard of fewer than 230 pages. It is designed to meet the needs and capabilities of SMEs, which are estimated to account for over 95 percent of all companies around the world. Compared with full IFRS (and many national accounting standards), simplified IFRS for SMEs is less complex in a number of ways:</p>
<ul data-index="6702">
<li data-index="6703">Topics not relevant for SMEs are omitted. Examples are earnings per share, interim financial reporting, and segment reporting.</li>
<li data-index="6704">Simplified IFRS for SMEs allows fewer accounting policy choices. Examples are no option to revalue property, equipment, or intangibles.</li>
<li data-index="6705">Many principles for recognizing and measuring assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses are simplified. For example, goodwill is amortized (as a result, there is no annual impairment test), and all borrowing and R&amp;D costs are expensed.</li>
<li data-index="6706">Significantly fewer disclosures are required (roughly 300 versus 3,000).</li>
<li data-index="6707">To further reduce standard overload, revisions to the IFRS for SMEs will be limited to once every three years.</li>
</ul>
<p data-index="6708">Thus, the option of using simplified IFRS helps SMEs meet the needs of their financial statement users while balancing the costs and benefits from a preparer perspective.<a href="#c24-note-0031-a" id="c24-note-0031" data-index="6709" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-note-0031-a" data-target-data-index="7291"><sup data-index="6710">31</sup></a></p>

<p data-index="6713">Notes to the financial statements should explain any significant financial events that took place after the formal statement of financial position date, but before the statements are authorized for issuance (hereafter referred to as the authorization date).

</figure>
<p data-index="6727"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-61" id="Page_24-61" data-index="6728"></span>A period of several weeks, and sometimes several months, may elapse after the end of the fiscal year but before the management or the board of directors authorizes issuance of the financial statements. Various activities involved in closing the books for the period and issuing the statements all take time: taking and pricing the inventory, reconciling subsidiary ledgers with controlling accounts, preparing necessary adjusting entries, ensuring that all transactions for the period have been entered, obtaining an audit of the financial statements by independent certified public accountants, and printing the annual report. During the period between the statement of financial position date and its authorization date, important transactions or other events may occur that materially affect the company's financial position or operating situation.</p>
<p data-index="6729">Many who read a statement of financial position believe the financial condition is constant, and they project it into the future. However, readers must be told if the company has experienced a significant change—e.g., sold one of its plants, acquired a subsidiary, suffered unusual losses, settled significant litigation, or experienced any other important event in the post-statement of financial position period. Without an explanation in a note, the reader might be misled and draw inappropriate conclusions.</p>
<p data-index="6730">Two types of events or transactions occurring after the statement of financial position date may have a material effect on the financial statements or may need disclosure so that readers interpret these statements accurately:</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="6731">
<li data-index="6732"><p class="normal" data-index="6733">Events that provide additional evidence about conditions <b data-index="6734">that existed</b> at the statement of financial position date, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. These events are referred to as <b data-index="6735">adjusted subsequent events</b> and require adjustments to the financial statements. All information available prior to the authorization date of the financial statements helps investors and creditors evaluate estimates previously made. To ignore these subsequent events is to pass up an opportunity to improve the accuracy of the financial statements. This first type of event encompasses information that an accountant would have recorded in the accounts had the information been known at the statement of financial position date.</p>
<p class="normal" data-index="6736">For example, if a loss on an account receivable results from a customer's bankruptcy subsequent to the statement of financial position date, the company adjusts the financial statements before their issuance. The bankruptcy stems from the customer's poor financial health existing at the statement of financial position date.</p>
<p class="normal" data-index="6737">The same criterion applies to settlements of litigation. The company must adjust the financial statements if the events that gave rise to the litigation, such as personal injury or patent infringement, took place prior to the statement of financial position date.</p></li>
<li data-index="6738"><p class="normal" data-index="6739">Events that provide evidence about conditions that <b data-index="6740">did not exist</b> at the statement of ­financial position date but arise subsequent to that date. These events are referred to as <b data-index="6741">non-adjusted subsequent events</b> and do not require adjustment of the financial statements. To illustrate, a loss resulting from a customer's fire or flood after the statement of financial position date does not reflect conditions existing at that date.</p>

</figure>
<p data-index="6781">Many subsequent events or developments do not require adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements. Typically, these are non-accounting events or conditions that management normally communicates by other means. These events include legislation, product changes, management changes, strikes, unionization, marketing agreements, and loss of important customers.</p>
<h5 data-index="6782"><span class="red" data-index="6783">Interim Reports</span></h5>
<p data-index="6784">Another source of information for the investor is interim reports. As noted earlier, interim reports cover periods of less than one year. The securities exchanges, market regulators, and the accounting profession have an active interest in the presentation of interim information.</p>
<p data-index="6785">Because of the short-term nature of the information in these reports, there is considerable controversy as to the general approach companies should employ. One group, which favors the <b data-index="6786">discrete approach</b>, believes that companies should treat each interim period as a separate accounting period. Using that treatment, companies would follow the principles for deferrals and accruals used for annual reports. In this view, companies should report accounting transactions as they occur, and expense recognition should not change with the period of time covered.</p>
<p data-index="6787">Another group, which favors the <b data-index="6788">integral approach</b>, believes that the interim report is an integral part of the annual report and that deferrals and accruals should take into consideration what will happen for the entire year. In this approach, companies should assign estimated expenses to parts of a year on the basis of sales volume or some other activity base. In general, IFRS requires companies to follow the discrete approach.</p>
<h6 data-index="6789">Interim Reporting Requirements</h6>
<p data-index="6790"><b data-index="6791">Under IFRS, companies should use the same accounting policies for interim reports and for annual reports.</b> They should recognize revenues in interim periods on the same basis as they do for annual periods. For example, if Cedars Corp. uses the percentage-of-completion method as the basis for recognizing revenue on an annual basis, it should use the percentage-of-completion method for interim reports as well. Also, Cedars should treat costs directly associated with revenues (product costs, such as materials, labor and related fringe benefits, and manufacturing overhead) in the same manner for interim reports as for annual reports.</p>
<p data-index="6792">Companies should use the same inventory pricing methods (FIFO, average-cost, etc.) for ­interim reports and for annual reports. However, companies may use the gross profit method for interim inventory pricing. But, they must disclose the method and adjustments to reconcile with annual inventory.</p>
<p data-index="6793"><b data-index="6794"><i data-index="6795">Discrete Approach</i></b> Following the discrete approach, companies record in interim reports revenues and expenses according to the revenue and expense recognition principles. This includes costs and expenses other than product costs (often referred to as period costs). No accruals or deferrals in anticipation of future events during the year should be reported. For example, the cost of a planned major periodic maintenance or overhaul for a company like <span class="red" data-index="6796"><b data-index="6797">Airbus</b></span> or other seasonal expenditure <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="24-63" id="Page_24-63" data-index="6798"></span>that is expected to occur late in the year is not anticipated for interim reporting purposes. The mere intention or necessity to incur expenditure related to the future is not sufficient to give rise to an obligation.</p>
<p data-index="6799">Or, a company like <span class="red" data-index="6800"><b data-index="6801">Carrefour</b></span> may budget certain costs expected to be incurred irregularly during the financial year, such as advertising and employee training costs. Those costs generally are discretionary even though they are planned and tend to recur from year to year. However, recognizing an obligation at the end of an interim financial reporting period for such costs that have not yet been incurred generally is not consistent with the definition of a liability.</p>
<p data-index="6802">While year-to-date measurements may involve changes in estimates of amounts reported in prior interim periods of the current financial year, the principles for recognizing assets, liabilities, income, and expenses for interim periods are the same as in annual financial statements. For example, <span class="red" data-index="6803"><b data-index="6804">Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc</b></span> records losses from inventory write-downs, restructurings, or impairments in an interim period similar to how it would treat these items in the annual financial statements (when incurred). However, if an estimate from a prior interim period changes in a subsequent interim period of that year, the original estimate is adjusted in the subsequent interim period.</p>
<p data-index="6805"><b data-index="6806"><i data-index="6807">Interim Disclosures</i></b> IFRS does not require a complete set of financial statements at the interim reporting date. Rather, companies may comply with the requirements by providing condensed financial statements and selected explanatory notes. Because users of interim financial reports also have access to the most recent annual financial report, companies only need provide explanation of significant events and transactions since the end of the last annual reporting period. Companies should report the following interim data at a minimum.</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="6808">
<li data-index="6809"><span class="normal" data-index="6810">Statement that the same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in the interim financial statements as compared with the most recent annual financial statements or, if those policies or methods have been changed, a description of the nature and effect of the change.</span></li>
<li data-index="6811"><span class="normal" data-index="6812">Explanatory comments about the seasonality or cyclicality of interim operations.</span></li>
<li data-index="6813"><span class="normal" data-index="6814">The nature and amount of items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income, or cash flows that are unusual because of their nature, size, or incidence.</span></li>

<li data-index="6817"><span class="normal" data-index="6818">Issuances, repurchases, and repayments of debt and equity securities.</span></li>
<li data-index="6819"><span class="normal" data-index="6820">Dividends paid (aggregate or per share) separately for ordinary shares and other shares.</span></li>
<li data-index="6821"><span class="normal" data-index="6822">Segment information, as required by <i data-index="6823">IFRS 8,</i> “Operating Segments.”</span></li>
<li data-index="6824"><span class="normal" data-index="6825">Changes in contingent liabilities or contingent assets since the end of the last annual reporting period.</span></li>
<li data-index="6826"><span class="normal" data-index="6827">Effect of changes in the composition of the company during the interim period, such as business combinations, obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries and long-term investments, restructurings, and discontinued operations.</span></li>
<li data-index="6828"><span class="normal" data-index="6829">Other material events subsequent to the end of the interim period that have not been reflected in the financial statements for the interim period.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="6830">If a complete set of financial statements is provided in the interim report, companies comply with the provisions of <i data-index="6831">IAS</i> 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements.”</p>
<h4 data-index="6832"><span class="blue" data-index="6833">On the Horizon</span></h4>
<p data-index="6834">Hans Hoogervorst, chairperson of the IASB, recently noted: “High quality financial information is the lifeblood of market-based economies. If the blood is of poor quality, then the body shuts down and the patient dies. It is the same with financial reporting. If investors cannot trust the numbers, then financial markets stop working. For market-based economies, that is really bad news. It is an essential public good for market-based economies. … And in the past 10 years, most of the world's economies—developed and emerging—have embraced IFRSs.” While the United States has yet to adopt IFRS, there is no question that IFRS and GAAP are converging quickly. We have provided expanded discussion in the <i data-index="6835">Global Views</i> and <i data-index="6836">IFRS Insights</i> to help you understand the issues surrounding convergence as they relate to intermediate accounting. After reading these discussions, you should realize that IFRS and GAAP are very similar in many areas, with differences in those areas revolving around some minor technical points. In other situations, the differences are major; for example, IFRS does not permit LIFO inventory accounting. Our hope is that the FASB and IASB can continue to narrow differences in accounting standards for use by companies around the world.</p>

<hr data-index="6844">
<p data-index="6845">As we discussed in <a href="c01.xhtml" data-index="6846" data-section-index="11">Chapter 1</a> and throughout the text, IFRS is gaining popularity around the world. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is still studying whether and how to incorporate IFRS in the accounting rules used by publicly traded companies in the United States. There is some debate on U.S. readiness to make the switch. For example, there are several areas in which the FASB and the IASB must iron out a number of technical accounting issues before they reach a substantially converged set of accounting standards. Here is a list of important areas yet to be converged:</p>
<ol style=" font-weight: bold;" data-index="6847">
<li data-index="6848"><span class="normal" data-index="6849"><b data-index="6850"><i data-index="6851">Error correction.</i></b> According to <i data-index="6852">IAS 8</i>, it's not always neces­sary to retrospectively restate financial results when a com­pany corrects errors, especially if the adjustment is impractical or too costly. GAAP, on the other hand, requires restatements in many error-correction cases.</span></li>
<li data-index="6853"><span class="normal" data-index="6854"><b data-index="6855"><i data-index="6856">Death of LIFO.</i></b> Last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting is prohibited under <i data-index="6857">IAS 2</i>, so any U.S. company using the method will have to abandon it (and the tax benefits) and move to another methodology. Although LIFO is permitted under GAAP, the repeal of LIFO for tax purposes is an ongoing debate.</span></li>
<li data-index="6858"><span class="normal" data-index="6859"><b data-index="6860"><i data-index="6861">Reversal of impairments</i></b>. <i data-index="6862">IAS 36</i> permits companies to reverse impairment losses up to the amount of the original impairment when the reason for the charge decreases or no longer exists. However, GAAP bans reversal.</span></li>
<li data-index="6863"><span class="normal" data-index="6864"><b data-index="6865"><i data-index="6866">PP&amp;E revaluation.</i></b> <i data-index="6867">IAS 16</i> allows for the revaluation of property, plant, and equipment, but the entire asset class must be revalued. That means a company can choose to use the revaluation model if the asset class's fair value can be measured reliably. But, it must choose to use one model or the other; both cannot be used at the same time. GAAP does not allow revaluation.</span></li>
<li data-index="6868"><span class="normal" data-index="6869"><b data-index="6870"><i data-index="6871">Component depreciation</i></b>. Also under <i data-index="6872">IAS 16</i>, companies must recognize and depreciate equipment components separately if the components can be physically separated from the asset and have different useful life spans. In practical terms, that means controllers will have to rely on the operations side of the business to help assess equipment components. GAAP allows component depreciation, but it is not required.</span></li>
<li data-index="6873"><span class="normal" data-index="6874"><b data-index="6875"><i data-index="6876">Development costs.</i></b> Based on <i data-index="6877">IAS 38</i>, companies are permitted to capitalize development costs as long as they meet six criteria. However, research costs are still expensed. GAAP requires that all R&amp;D costs be charged to expense when incurred.</span></li>
<li data-index="6878"><span class="normal" data-index="6879"><b data-index="6880"><i data-index="6881">Sustainability reporting.</i></b> Such reporting on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues is not required by GAAP or IFRS. However, a growing ­number of companies (especially those who use IFRS) are voluntarily disclosing supplementary Information on ESG. While much of this information is nonfinancial, the effects of sustainability efforts do have financial consequences—about which investors want to know. As discussed in <a href="c12.xhtml" data-index="6882" data-section-index="22">Chapter 12</a>, ESG reporting standards are coming online and if companies continue to get on the sustainability reporting bandwagon, such reporting will add to the heft of the annual reporting package.</span></li>
</ol>
<p data-index="6883">Some are already debating what will happen if and when U.S. companies adopt these new standards. It is almost certain that expanded disclosure will be needed to help users navigate accounting reports upon adoption of IFRS. As one accounting analyst remarked, “Get ready for an avalanche of footnotes.” Since using IFRS requires more judgment than using GAAP, two to three times as many footnotes will be needed to explain the rationales for accounting approaches. So while principles-based standards should promote more comparability, they require investors to dig into the disclosures in the footnotes.</p>

When management concludes there is substantial doubt about the going concern ­assumption, this must be disclosed along with information to explain that conclusion. Management should also consider and disclose actions that, if implemented, will mitigate the conditions that could lead to a going concern disclosure. <b data-index="7183">[<a href="#c24-bib-0007" id="c24-bib-0007-1" data-index="7184" data-section-index="34" data-section-idref="c24-bib-0007" data-target-data-index="6612">7</a>]</b></p></aside>

The SEC has implemented other regulations to ensure that investors get high-quality disclosures. For example, as discussed in <a href="c04.xhtml" data-index="7249" data-section-index="14">Chapter 4</a>, the SEC was concerned that companies may use pro forma reporting to deflect investor attention from bad news. In response, the SEC issued Regulation G, which requires companies to reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. This regulation provides investors with a roadmap to analyze adjustments companies make to their GAAP numbers to arrive at pro forma results. [See SEC Regulation G, “Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” Release No. 33-8176 (March 28, 2003).] Regulation FD (Release Nos. 33-7881) was issued in 2000 to address the concern that some analysts were receiving information sooner than the general public (e.g., during conference calls with analysts when earnings releases were discussed). Regulation FD requires that when relevant information is released, all have equal access to it.</p></aside>

In addition, companies also prepare forecasts and projections for use by third parties in public offering documents (requiring financial forecasts), tax-oriented investments, and financial feasibility studies. Use of forward-looking data has been enhanced by the increased capability of microcomputers to analyze, compare, and manipulate large quantities of data.</p></aside>

Over a recent three-year period, 8 percent of the companies on the NYSE were sued because of an alleged lack of financial disclosure. Companies complain that they are subject to lawsuits whenever the stock price drops. And as one executive noted, “You can even be sued if the stock price goes up—because you did not disclose the good news fast enough.”</p></aside>
